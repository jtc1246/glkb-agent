To answer this, we need to consider the mechanisms of action of both lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine. Lysosomotropic amines affect lysosomal function, potentially impacting antigen presentation, while cyclosporine inhibits calcineurin, affecting T-cell activation. Synergy would imply that their combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects. Given that both agents target different pathways in T-cell activation and function, it is plausible that their effects could be synergistic.\",\"answer\":\"yes\"}",

PET/CT is known for its ability to detect metabolic activity, which can be useful in identifying metastases that might not be visible on CT alone. However, multidetector CT is highly effective in providing detailed anatomical images. The answer depends on whether the metabolic information from PET/CT significantly changes the staging or treatment plan compared to using multidetector CT alone. Given that PET/CT can sometimes detect additional lesions or provide better characterization of lesions, it is likely that it adds something to multidetector CT in this context.\",\"answer\":\"yes\"}",
