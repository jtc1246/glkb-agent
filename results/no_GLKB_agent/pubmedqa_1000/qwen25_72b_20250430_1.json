Frequency compression is a technique used in hearing aids to make high-frequency sounds more accessible to those with hearing loss, but it can also affect speech perception in individuals with normal hearing. Cognitive functions such as working memory, attention, and processing speed are known to play a role in speech recognition, especially in challenging listening conditions. However, for individuals with both normal hearing and normal cognition, these factors might not significantly influence their ability to recognize frequency-compressed speech, as they already have the necessary auditory and cognitive resources to process speech effectively.\", \"answer\": \"no\"}",
