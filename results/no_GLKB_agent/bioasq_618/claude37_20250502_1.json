In evolutionary biology, WGDs involve duplication of the entire genome, while SSDs involve duplication of individual genes or small genomic regions. \\n\\nBased on scientific literature, WGDs in yeast (particularly the well-studied ancient WGD in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) tend to show less functional divergence than SSDs. This is because duplicated pairs from WGDs often maintain similar functions and experience more constraints due to dosage balance requirements and protein interaction networks. In contrast, SSDs typically show greater functional divergence, with one copy more likely to develop new functions (neofunctionalization) or partition ancestral functions (subfunctionalization).\\n\\nStudies in yeast have shown that SSD-derived paralogs diverge more rapidly in expression patterns, protein interactions, and functions compared to WGD-derived paralogs. This is consistent with the gene balance hypothesis, which suggests that WGD-derived duplicates are under selection to maintain stoichiometric balance.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is no - whole-genome duplications are generally LESS divergent than small-scale duplications in yeast, not more divergent.\", \"answer\": \"no\"}",

This is because regions with low mappability often contain repetitive elements that can facilitate non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR), which is a major mechanism for CNV formation.

To answer this, I need to consider whether non-coding regions of MEF2C can also cause developmental disorders when altered.\\n\\nMEF2C (Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2C) is a transcription factor gene that plays important roles in neurodevelopment. Mutations in MEF2C are known to cause MEF2C haploinsufficiency syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder.\\n\\nResearch has shown that not only coding region mutations but also deletions or mutations in regulatory regions of MEF2C, such as enhancers and promoters, can cause developmental disorders. Non-coding variants affecting MEF2C expression or regulation have been documented to cause similar phenotypes to coding mutations.\\n\\nFor example, deletions that include regulatory elements upstream of MEF2C, without affecting the coding sequence itself, have been reported in patients with developmental disorders. Additionally, chromosomal rearrangements affecting the regulatory landscape of MEF2C can also lead to developmental abnormalities.\\n\\nTherefore, changes in both coding and non-coding regions of MEF2C can cause developmental disorders.\", \"answer\": \"no\"}",

To answer this question, I need to recall the epidemiology of this condition.\\n\\nFrom what I know about trichotillomania, it does not affect males and females equally. The condition is significantly more common in females than in males. While it can occur in both sexes, epidemiological studies have consistently shown that trichotillomania has a female predominance, with estimates suggesting that 70-90% of those seeking treatment are female. The female-to-male ratio is often cited as being between 3:1 and 10:1, depending on the study.\\n\\nThis gender disparity is particularly pronounced in adults, though the sex ratio may be more equal in children with early-onset trichotillomania.\\n\\nTherefore, trichotillomania is not encountered with equal frequency in males and females.\", \"answer\": \"no\"}",

It works by activating the Nrf2 pathway, which is involved in cellular defense against oxidative stress. Importantly, omaveloxolone does NOT activate NFkB (Nuclear Factor kappa B). In fact, studies have shown that omaveloxolone and similar compounds can actually inhibit NFkB signaling. NFkB is a different transcription factor involved in inflammation and immune responses. So omaveloxolone is not an activator of NFkB, but rather an Nrf2 activator that may indirectly suppress NFkB activity.\", \"answer\": \"no\"}",

Cortisol is a stress hormone that can be measured in saliva, and its levels may increase in response to stressful or painful stimuli. In neonatal research and clinical practice, various biomarkers including cortisol have been investigated as objective measures of pain. Studies have shown that salivary cortisol levels can indeed increase in response to painful procedures in neonates, and it has been used as one of several physiological markers to assess pain responses in this population. While it has limitations (like time lag in response and influence by factors other than pain), salivary cortisol measurement is a documented approach for pain assessment in neonates.\", \"answer\": \"yes\"}",

Music therapy has been found to decrease physiological indicators of pain (heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation) and behavioral indicators (crying time, facial expressions of pain) during procedures like heel lances and venipuncture.\\n\\nSystematic reviews and meta-analyses have generally concluded that music interventions can be effective as a non-pharmacological approach to managing procedural pain in neonates.

In prokaryotes, protein synthesis begins with N-formylmethionine (fMet). However, after translation, the initial methionine is often cleaved off during post-translational modifications in many proteins. Additionally, there are rare alternative start codons in some organisms that can code for other amino acids to begin protein synthesis. So while methionine is the standard starting amino acid for protein synthesis, not all mature proteins retain it, and there are some exceptions to methionine being the initial amino acid incorporated during translation.\", \"answer\": \"no\"}",

There is substantial evidence for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in plants and some animals. In mammals, including humans, most epigenetic marks are erased during gametogenesis and early embryonic development (epigenetic reprogramming), but some epigenetic modifications can escape this reprogramming and be transmitted to offspring.\\n\\nSo yes, epigenetic changes can be heritable, though the extent and mechanisms vary across species and specific epigenetic modifications.\", \"answer\": \"yes\"}",

A key characteristic of enhancers is that they can function at considerable distances from their target genes. They can be located upstream, downstream, or even within introns of the genes they regulate. Some enhancers can act on genes that are hundreds of kilobases away on the same chromosome, and the physical distance can be bridged through DNA looping, which brings the enhancer and promoter regions into proximity in three-dimensional space. This long-range action is a defining feature of enhancers, distinguishing them from promoter elements that are necessarily adjacent to the genes they regulate.
