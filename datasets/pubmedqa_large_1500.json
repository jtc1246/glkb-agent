      "Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetized with desflurane or halothane, intubated, and mechanically ventilated. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood gases, and pH were controlled. Body temperature was maintained at 37.5-38 degrees C. Animals were assigned to one of four groups according to the anaesthetic type (halothane or desflurane) and the duration of anaesthesia: \"short-duration\", during the preparation only; \"long-duration\", during both preparation and ischaemia. Twenty-four hours after MCAo, infarcts were visualized by staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Two additional groups of rats were subjected to the same protocol as that of long-duration halothane and long-duration desflurane with additional pericranial temperature measurements made.",
      "Physiological parameters were comparable between the groups but MAP was higher (P<0.0001) in the short-duration groups. In the short-duration groups, cerebral infarct volumes were not significantly different between anaesthetics (short-duration halothane: 288 (61) mm(3), mean (SD); short-duration desflurane: 269 (71) mm(3), P>0.56). Compared with the awake state (short-duration groups), halothane and desflurane significantly reduced infarct volumes (long-duration halothane: 199 (54) mm(3), P<0.0047 vs short-duration halothane; long-duration desflurane: 121 (55) mm(3), P<0.0001 vs short-duration desflurane). The mean infarct volume in the long-duration desflurane group was significantly lower than that in the long-duration halothane group (P<0.0053).

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Aging is typically accompanied by memory decline and changes in hippocampal function. Among these changes is a decline in the activity of the dentate gyrus (DG) during behavior. Lasting memory, however, is thought to also require recapitulation of recent memory traces during subsequent rest - a phenomenon, termed memory trace reactivation, which is compromised in hippocampal CA1 with progressive age. This process has yet to be assessed in the aged DG, despite its prominent role in age-related memory impairment. Using zif268 transcription to measure granule cell recruitment, DG activity in adult and aged animals was assessed both during spatial exploration and as animals remained at rest in the home cage in order to detect potential memory-related replay.",
      "Consistent with the observation of memory trace reactivation in DG, the probability that an individual granule cell transcribes zif268 during rest in the animal's home cage is increased by recent experience in a novel environment. Surprisingly, a comparable increase was observed in the probability of granule cells in the aged DG expressing zif268 during rest. Moreover, no significant age-related difference was observed in the number of granule cells expressing zif268 during rest. Thus, the number and pattern of granule cell expression of zif268 during rest is preserved in aged animals, despite a significant decline in exploration-related zif268 expression."

      "The increasing number of completely sequenced bacterial genomes allows comparing their architecture and genetic makeup. Such new information highlights the crucial role of lateral genetic exchanges in bacterial evolution and speciation.",
      "Here we analyzed the twelve sequenced genomes of Streptococcus pyogenes by a naïve approach that examines the preferential nucleotide usage along the chromosome, namely the usage of G versus C (GC-skew) and T versus A (TA-skew). The cumulative GC-skew plot presented an inverted V-shape composed of two symmetrical linear segments, where the minimum and maximum corresponded to the origin and terminus of DNA replication. In contrast, the cumulative TA-skew presented a V-shape, which segments were interrupted by several steep slopes regions (SSRs), indicative of a different nucleotide composition bias. Each S. pyogenes genome contained up to nine individual SSRs, encompassing all described strain-specific prophages. In addition, each genome contained a similar unique non-phage SSR, the core of which consisted of 31 highly homologous genes. This core includes the M-protein, other mga-related factors and other virulence genes, totaling ten intrinsic virulence genes. In addition to a high content in virulence-related genes and to a peculiar nucleotide bias, this SSR, which is 47 kb-long in a M1GAS strain, harbors direct repeats and a tRNA gene, suggesting a mobile element. Moreover, its complete absence in a M-protein negative group A Streptococcus natural isolate demonstrates that it could be spontaneously lost, but in vitro deletion experiments indicates that its excision occurred at very low rate. The stability of this SSR, combined to its presence in all sequenced S. pyogenes sequenced genome, suggests that it results from an ancient acquisition."

The present study investigated the mechanism mediating this effect, its occurrence in other cells involved in atherogenesis, and whether it takes place in experimental atherosclerosis.",

Direct blockade of geranylgeranyl transferase I by GGTI-286, treatment with the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 or silencing of the geranylgeranylated GTPase Rac2 by siRNA closely mimicked the action of atorvastatin. In contrast, inactivation of other geranylgeranylated proteins such as RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC or Rac1 did not affect PTX3 release. In addition, we found that atorvastatin also decreased PTX3 secretion in aortic SMCs through a mechanism likely dependent on protein geranylgeranylation, while no effect was observed in monocytes.

      "Due to their ability to regulate various signalling pathways (cytokines, hormones, growth factors), the suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins are thought to be promising therapeutic targets for metabolic and inflammatory disorders. Hence, their role in vivo has to be precisely determined.",

      "We demonstrate here that chronic expression of SOCS-3 in skeletal muscle leads to overweight in mice and worsening of high-fat diet-induced systemic insulin resistance. Counter-intuitively, insulin sensitivity in muscle of transgenic mice appears to be unaltered. However, following constitutive SOCS-3 production, several genes had deregulated expression, among them other members of the SOCS family. This could maintain the insulin signal into skeletal muscle. Interestingly, we found that SOCS-3 interacts with calcineurin, which has been implicated in muscle contractility. In Socs-3 transgenic muscle, this leads to delocalisation of calcineurin to the fibre periphery. Relevant to this finding, Socs-3 transgenic animals had dilatation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum associated with swollen mitochondria and decreased voluntary activity."

Compared with WT mice, arterial lesions grew significantly larger in Tg(p22vsmc) (P<0.001) and demonstrated elevated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels at all time points examined (P<0.001, n=4 animals per time point), probably related to increased expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha via SMC oxidative stress in the Tg(p22vsmc) arteries, both basally (203+/-12% versus WT, P<0.001, n=3) and after lesion formation. Interestingly, Tg(p22vsmc) lesions were complicated by extensive neointimal angiogenesis.

In vivo, IPC up-regulated miR-21 expression 24 h after the second ischemia, while PHD2 expression decreased significantly with up-regulation of HIF-1α protein and VEGF mRNA. MiR-21 induced by delayed IPC was effectively inhibited by the LNA anti-miR-21. With down-regulation of miR-21, the protection of delayed IPC was attenuated and PHD2 protein was increased. Furthermore, up-regulation of HIF-1α and VEGF were abolished after the LNA anti-miR-21 treatment."

Intra-myocardial TNFalpha- and IL10-messenger RNA were detected by competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and quantification of cytokine synthesis by Western blot. Levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in cardiac lymph and in arterial and coronary venous blood were examined during and after CPB. Myocardial cell damage was assessed by histologic and ultrastructural anomalies of tissue probes taken 6 h after CPB.",
      "Synthesis of IL10 was significantly higher, while that of TNFalpha was significantly lower, in pigs that were in moderate hypothermia during surgery than in the others. In contrast with normothermia, moderate hypothermia was also associated with significantly lower cumulative cardiac lymphatic flow during and after CPB, significantly lower lymphatic cTnI concentrations after CPB, significantly lower percentages of myocardial cell necrosis and a significantly lower score of ultrastructural anomalies of myocardial cells. While the percentage of apoptotic cells was not different between groups, the apoptosis/necrosis ratio tended to be higher in animals that were in moderate hypothermia during surgery. In all animals, TNFalpha synthesis correlated positively while IL10 production correlated negatively with necrosis and total cell death, respectively."

The extent of such damage was evaluated by measuring the injured area stained dark blue with Evans blue. Rats were given antibiotics (ampicillin, aztreonam or vancomycin) p.o., or intraperitoneal LPS (a TLR4 ligand) or neutralising antibodies against neutrophils, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, or monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1. Furthermore, the intestinal ulcerogenicity of indomethacin was examined in TLR4-mutant, TLR4(-/-), and MyD88(-/-) mice.",
      "Indomethacin induced small intestinal damage with an increase in expression of TNF-alpha and MCP-1 in both rats and mice. Antibodies against neutrophils, TNF-alpha and MCP-1 inhibited the damage by 83%, 67% and 63%, respectively, in rats. Ampicillin and aztreonam also inhibited this damage, and decreased the number of Gram-negative bacteria in the small intestinal contents of the rat. However, vancomycin, which exhibited no activity against Gram-negative bacteria, had no preventive effect against this damage. Administration of LPS 1 h after indomethacin aggravated the damage, whereas LPS pretreatment inhibited it with reduction of expression of TLR4 and cytokines. In TLR4-mutant mice, the damage and cytokine expression were markedly inhibited. TLR4(-/-) and MyD88(-/-) mice were also resistant to the damage."

Human and mouse diseased liver contain two subpopulations of macrophages with different ontogenetic origins: prenatal yolk sac-derived Kupffer cells and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages. We examined the individual role(s) of Kupffer cells and monocyte-derived macrophages in the induction of LPC proliferation using clodronate liposome deletion of Kupffer cells and adoptive transfer of monocytes, respectively, in the choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet model of liver injury and regeneration.

In addition, from the therapeutic point of view, we focused on sub-picomolar concentration of SN for further mechanistic studies. We found that 10(-14) M of SN failed to protect DA neurons against MPP+-induced toxicity in the absence of microglia. More importantly, SN failed to show a protective effect in neuron-glia cultures from mice lacking functional NADPH oxidase (PHOX), a key enzyme for extracellular superoxide production in immune cells.

Notably, mRNA coding for subunit α7 which is proposed to convey the nicotinic anti-inflammatory response of macrophages from other sources than the lung was not detected. RT-PCR data were supported by immunohistochemistry on AM isolated by lavage, as well as in lung tissue sections and by Western blotting. Neither whole-cell patch clamp recordings nor measurements of [Ca2+]i revealed changes in membrane current in response to ACh and in [Ca2+]i in response to nicotine, respectively. However, nicotine (100 μM), given 2 min prior to ATP, significantly reduced the ATP-induced rise in [Ca2+]i by 30%.

Putative mechanisms implicate leukocytes in stored blood that generate immunomodulatory mediators as the stored blood ages. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to describe the effect of prestorage leukoreduction (PS-LR) on the detrimental clinical effects of increasing age on blood products used in trauma patients.",
      "All patients receiving >or=6 units of packed red cells and surviving >or=48 hours since May 1999 when institutional universal PS-LR was begun were identified. Transfusion requirements, demographic data, and causes of death were collected. Blood bank records were reviewed to determine the age of each unit of blood transfused. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between the age of PS-LR transfused blood and mortality after adjusting for total transfusion requirement, patient age, Injury Severity Score, head Abbreviated Injury Score, mechanism of injury, and gender. A subgroup analysis was performed excluding those patients in whom care was withdrawn at 48 hours to 72 hours postinjury for brain death or neurologic devastation.",
      "A total of 399 patients, receiving 6,603 units of blood, met inclusion criteria. Mortality analysis showed that increasing Injury Severity Score, patient age, head Abbreviated Injury Score, and number of units of packed red cells transfused were all independently associated with an increased risk of death. When mean age of blood was analyzed as a continuous variable, a significant reduction in the risk of death with increasing mean age of transfused PS-LR blood was noted (odds ratio [OR], 0.959; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.924-0.996). Both of these findings persisted when the mean age of blood was dichotomized at 14 days (OR, 0.426; 95% CI, 0.182-0.998) and 21 days (OR, 0.439; 95% CI, 0.225-0.857). The area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristics of our mortality model was 0.90. After excluding 13 patients in whom care was withdrawn 48 hours to 72 hours postinjury for brain death or neurologic devastation, the mortality analysis still showed that increasing injury severity, number of units of packed red cells transfused, and age were all independently associated with an increased risk of death. The protective effect of receiving older blood seen in the all-cause mortality analysis disappeared because no association was found between odds of dying and increasing age of packed red blood cells units transfused. This was true whether the mean age of transfused blood was dichotomized at 14 days (OR, 0.93; CI, 0.30-2.83) or at 21 days (OR, 0.54; CI, 0.25-1.16)."

We have previously shown that the postprandial adipose tissue blood flow (ATBF) increase is dependent on insulin sensitivity.

We hypothesized that insulin may act indirectly via sympathetic activation, mainly in the postprandial period, and that nitric oxide may be an overall major regulator of subcutaneous ATBF.",

Healthy subjects (body mass index, 18 to 31 kg/m2) were challenged with 75 g glucose for endogenous stimulation of ATBF. We used the novel \"microinfusion\" technique, which allows for simultaneous local delivery of pharmacological agents (or contralateral saline) and measurement of ATBF with the 133Xe washout method.

PPP enzyme expression was increased in rapidly dividing glioblastoma cells, whereas glycolysis enzymes were decreased. Conversely, glycolysis enzymes were elevated in migrating cells, whereas PPP enzymes were diminished. Knockdown of G6PD reduced glioblastoma cell proliferation, whereas ALDOC knockdown decreased migration. Enzyme inhibitors had similar effects. G6PD knockdown in a highly proliferative but noninvasive glioblastoma cell line resulted in prolonged survival of mice with intracerebral xenografts, whereas ALDOC knockdown shortened survival.

Stimulation of SMCs with thrombin (30 nmol/L) resulted in release of FGF-2 into the pericellular space within 10 minutes. Preincubation with cyclodextrin-cholesterol caused accumulation of cellular cholesterol, increased thrombin-induced FGF-2 release, and stimulated FGF-2 de novo synthesis.

In this report, incisions of various lengths are modeled, and plausible alternative incision scenarios for various procedures (e.g., Nissen, appendectomy) are compared.",

In the present study, incomplete laceration and contusion injuries were made to test for neuroanatomical correlates between areas of white matter damage/sparing at the lesion epicenter and the presence/absence of allodynia. After incomplete laceration lesions and 6 weeks of behavioral testing, histological reconstruction and analysis of the lesion epicenters revealed a significant difference (P < .001) in the amount of ventrolateral funiculus (VLF) asymmetry between rats showing pain-like responses evoked by touch (74.5% +/- 8.4% side-to-side difference in VLF damage) versus those not responding to touch (11.3% +/- 4.4% side-to-side difference in VLF damage). A 5-week mean allodynia score for each rat that incorporates a full range of forces that are all innocuous in intact controls revealed that the degree of hypersensitivity at level is related to the extent of VLF asymmetry after SCI. No other damaged spinal white matter or gray matter area was correlated with sensitivity to touch. Similar findings were obtained for rats receiving T8 contusions, a more clinically relevant injury. These data suggest that different extents of damage/sparing between the 2 sides of VLF probably are a requisite for the development of allodynia after SCI."

      "We tested 12 human melanoma lines (2 radial growth phase (RGP), 3 vertical growth phase (VGP), and 7 metastatic (MM)) for ability to induce HMVECs to invade/migrate into collagen and form capillarylike networks. HMVEC monolayers were overlaid with 3-dimensional collagen gels embedded with melanoma cells alone (M), fibroblasts alone (F), or a 1:1 mixture of the 2 cells (M+F). After 5 days, gels were removed, fixed, and HMVEC networks were quantified by von Willebrand's factor (vWF) immunofluorescence. The influence of soluble factors on HMVEC invasion/migration into collagen was assessed with the use of acellular 3-D collagen gels overlaid on HMVEC monolayers, cultured with conditioned media (CM) derived from monolayers of M, F, or M+F. Angiogenic growth factors involved in the observed invasion/migration were identified with the use of a RayBio Cytokine Antibody Array (RayBiotech, Norcross, Ga).",
      "Cell line-specific variability in melanoma-supported angiogenesis was observed only when in combination with fibroblasts (analysis of variance [ANOVA], P < .01). Melanoma plus fibroblasts uniformly resulted in a significantly higher angiogenic response than melanoma alone (P < .05). One vertical growth phase and one metastatic melanoma line, while weakly angiogenic alone, induced significantly higher angiogenesis than either fibroblast or melanoma alone (P < .05) when combined with fibroblasts. CM from M or M+F induced significantly less HMVEC invasion/migration into collagen than CM from fibroblasts alone. Interleukin 8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 were identified as significantly elevated in the media derived from M+F cultures, compared with either cell type alone."

      "Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are of great therapeutic potential after myocardial ischemic injury. However, little is known about the biological characteristics of MSCs in patients with coronary artery disease and their effects on infracted myocardium. The present study evaluated the biological characteristics of MSCs from patients with coronary artery disease and their effects after being transplanted into infarcted myocardium using a rat model.",
      "Sternal bone marrow aspirates were taken at the time of coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Mononuclear cells isolated from bone marrow were cultured based on plastic adherence. The morphology and growth characteristics of MSCs were observed in primary and successive passages. A myocardial infarction model was created in 27 adult rats. Two weeks later, animals were randomized into two groups: culture medium (group I, n=13) or MSCs (2x10(6)) from early passages labeled with BrdU (group II, n=14) were injected into the infarcted myocardium. Echocardiography, histological examination, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed four weeks after cell transplantation.",
      "Flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that adherent spindle cells from bone marrow are mesenchymal stem cells (positive for CD29 and CD44, but negative for CD34 and CD45). Growth curves showed that MSCs have great proliferative capability especially at early passages. MSCs implantation in the infarcted border zone improved left ventricular function significantly in group II compared with group I. However, despite improved left ventricular function, we did not observe significant regeneration of cardiac myocytes. Immunohistochemistry revealed only the expression of desmin in the engrafted MSCs, a marker of premature myocyte. Moreover, the improved left ventricular function in this study seemed to be secondary to the beneficial reverse remodeling induced by the increase of collagen in infarcted zone, the decrease in the adjacent myocardium, and the increase of neovascularization (capillary density: 192+/-7.8/mm2 in group II vs. 165+/-5.9/mm2 in group I, P<0.05). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results showed the expression levels of collagen I, collagen III, SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1), and VEGF (vascular endothelia growth factor) in the infarcted border zone were significantly higher in the MSCs treated group."

      "The type 1 fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR-1) is the only high affinity receptor for fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) in the rat myocardium, and is essential for normal growth and development of the heart. Levels of FGFR-1 are developmentally regulated, being high in embryonic cardiac myocytes. Also, FGFR-1 exists as both 'long' and 'short' isoforms, and there is a switch from predominant expression of the 'long' isoform in the embryo to the 'short' isoform in the adult heart. Both the decrease in receptor levels and the isoform switch in postnatal cardiac myocytes correlate with a loss of proliferative potential. We investigated whether an increase in either 'long' or 'short' FGFR-1 isoforms could stimulate proliferation in postnatal rat cardiac myocyte cultures.",
      "Previously we cloned cDNAs corresponding to 'long' (L) and 'short' (S) FGFR-1 isoforms from embryonic mouse hearts. Hybrid FGFR-1(L) and (S) genes, directed by a myosin light chain-2 promoter and SV40 enhancer sequences, were generated and used to transiently transfect neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Overexpression of FGFR-1 mRNA and protein was detected by RNA blotting and immunocytochemistry. Ligand-crosslinking confirmed the presence of specific receptors capable of binding FGF-2 on the cell membrane. Overexpression of either FGFR-1(L) or (S) was associated with stimulation of proliferation as assessed by significant increases in bromodeoxyuridine uptake (DNA synthesis) and cell number. To determine whether this response was FGF-2 specific, the level of FGF-2 was assessed in the culture medium of cardiac myocytes overexpressing FGFR-1 isoforms. A three-fold increase was detected in the media of cardiac myocytes overexpressing either FGFR-1(L) or (S) compared to control levels. Neutralization of this FGF-2 with antibodies inhibited the proliferative response."

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "STAT5A and STAT5B are important transcription factors that play a key role in regulation of several important physiological processes including proliferation, survival, mediation of responses to cytokines and in regulating gender differences in drug response genes such as the hepatic cytochrome P450s (CYPs) that are responsible for a large majority of drug metabolism reactions in the human body. STAT5A and STAT5b have a high degree of sequence homology and have been reported to have largely similar functions. Recent studies have, however, indicated that they can also often have distinct and unique roles in regulating gene expression.",
      "In this study, we evaluated the association of STAT5A and STAT5B mRNA expression levels with those of several key hepatic cytochrome P450s (CYPs) and hepatic transcription factors (TFs) and evaluated the potential roles of STAT5A and 5b in mediating gender differences in these CYPs and TFs.",
      "Expression profiling for major hepatic CYP isoforms and transcription factors was performed using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in 102 human liver samples (57 female, 45 male). Real time PCR gene expression data for selected CYPs and TFs was available on a subset of 50 human liver samples (25 female, 25 male) and was used to validate the RNA-seq findings.",
      "While STAT5A demonstrated significant negative correlation with expression levels of multiple hepatic transcription factors (including NR1I2 and HNF4A) and DMEs such as CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, STAT5B expression was observed to demonstrate positive associations with several CYPs and TFs analyzed. As STAT5A and STAT5B have been shown to be important in regulation of gender differences in CYPs, we also analyzed STAT5A and 5b associations with CYPs and TFs separately in males and females and observed gender dependent differential associations of STATs with several CYPs and TFs. Results from the real time PCR validation largely supported our RNA-seq findings."

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Serum uric acid levels in humans are influenced by diet, cellular breakdown, and renal elimination, and correlate with blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, gout, and cardiovascular disease. Recent genome-wide association scans have found common genetic variants of SLC2A9 to be associated with increased serum urate level and gout. The SLC2A9 gene encodes a facilitative glucose transporter, and it has two splice variants that are highly expressed in the proximal nephron, a key site for urate handling in the kidney. We investigated whether SLC2A9 is a functional urate transporter that contributes to the longstanding association between urate and blood pressure in man.",
      "We expressed both SLC2A9 splice variants in Xenopus laevis oocytes and found both isoforms mediate rapid urate fluxes at concentration ranges similar to physiological serum levels (200-500 microM). Because SLC2A9 is a known facilitative glucose transporter, we also tested whether glucose or fructose influenced urate transport. We found that urate is transported by SLC2A9 at rates 45- to 60-fold faster than glucose, and demonstrated that SLC2A9-mediated urate transport is facilitated by glucose and, to a lesser extent, fructose. In addition, transport is inhibited by the uricosuric benzbromarone in a dose-dependent manner (Ki = 27 microM). Furthermore, we found urate uptake was at least 2-fold greater in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells overexpressing SLC2A9 splice variants than nontransfected kidney cells. To confirm that our findings were due to SLC2A9, and not another urate transporter, we showed that urate transport was diminished by SLC2A9-targeted siRNA in a second mammalian cell line. In a cohort of men we showed that genetic variants of SLC2A9 are associated with reduced urinary urate clearance, which fits with common variation at SLC2A9 leading to increased serum urate. We found no evidence of association with hypertension (odds ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9 to 1.05, p > 0.33) by meta-analysis of an SLC2A9 variant in six case-control studies including 11,897 participants. In a separate meta-analysis of four population studies including 11,629 participants we found no association of SLC2A9 with systolic (effect size -0.12 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.43, p = 0.664) or diastolic blood pressure (effect size -0.03 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.31, p = 0.82)."

The results showed that the relative expression of IRF-1 in DCs is obviously increased in patients with ACS. The overexpression or silencing of IRF-1 expression could effectively promote or attenuate the maturation and function of DCs.

However, it is still undiscovered whether circadian rhythm of pain exists in rodents and the specific mechanism that may underlie it. Our study was conducted to investigate the rhythmic changes of hyperalgesia behavior in a chronic constrictive injury (CCI) model of rodents and to explore the role of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 2B (NR2B)-cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) signaling pathway in this pain rhythm.",

The relative mRNA and protein expression of NR2B, CREB and CRTC1 in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and the dorsal horn were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot.

Since hypertension predisposes males to erectile dysfunction, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of PSD on genital reflexes in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) compared to the Wistar strain. We also extended our study to examine how PSD affect steroid hormone concentrations involved in genital events in both experimental models.",
      "The first experiment investigated the effects of PSD on genital reflexes of Wistar and SHR rats challenged by saline and cocaine (n = 10/group). To further examine the impact of the PSD on concentrations of sexual hormones, we performed a hormonal analysis of testosterone and progesterone in the Wistar and in SHR strains. Since after PSD progesterone concentrations decreased in the SHR compared to the Wistar PSD group we extended our study by investigating whether progesterone (25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg) or testosterone (0.5 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg) administration during PSD would have a facilitator effect on the occurrence of genital reflexes in this hypertensive strain.",

These genital reflexes was potentiated by cocaine in Wistar rats whereas this scenario did not promote significant enhancement in PE and EJ in hypertensive rats, and the percentage of SHR displaying genital reflexes still figured significantly lower than that of the Wistar strain. As for hormone concentrations, both sleep-deprived Wistar and SHR showed lower testosterone concentrations than their respective controls. Sleep deprivation promoted an increase in concentrations of progesterone in Wistar rats, whereas no significant alterations were found after PSD in the SHR strain, which did not present enhancement in erectile responses. In order to explore the role of progesterone in the occurrence of genital reflexes, SHR were treated daily during the sleep deprivation period with progesterone; after the administration of this hormone and challenge with cocaine, we observed a significant increase in erectile events compared with the vehicle PSD SHR+cocaine group."

      "At biopsy, 89% of patients had no GP5, and 11% (76/718) had GP5. There were no differences in age, comorbid illness, T stage, prostate-specific antigen, or the use or duration of androgen deprivation therapy between GS8 without GP5 and GS8-10 with GP5. The presence of GP5 predicted lower FFM (p < 0.002; hazard ratio [HR] 3.4 [1.7-7.1]); CSS (p < 0.0001; HR 12.9 [5.4-31]); and OS (p < 0.0001; HR 3.6 [2.0-6.5]) in comparison with GS8 (without GP5). The 8-year FFM, CSS, and OS were 89%, 98%, and 57%, respectively, for those with Gleason 8 prostate cancer without GP5 in comparison with 61%, 55%, and 31%, respectively, for those with GP5. In addition, both FFM and CSS were strongly influenced by androgen deprivation therapy given concurrently with RT. On multivariate analysis, GP5 was the strongest prognostic factor for all clinical endpoints, including OS."

This modification, which mediates protein-membrane and protein-protein interactions, is characterized by the covalent attachment of a fifteen-carbon farnesyl or twenty-carbon geranylgeranyl group to the cysteine residue of a carboxyl terminal CaaX motif. In Arabidopsis, era1 mutants lacking protein farnesyltransferase exhibit enlarged meristems, supernumerary floral organs, an enhanced response to abscisic acid (ABA), and drought tolerance. In contrast, ggb mutants lacking protein geranylgeranyltransferase type 1 exhibit subtle changes in ABA and auxin responsiveness, but develop normally.",

Cell viability after seeding was analyzed by AlamarBlue Assay. At the various stages of experiment, cell morphology was examined by histology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal microscopy.",
      "A porous 3-D network of randomly oriented nanofibers appeared to support cell attachment in a way similar to traditionally used tissue culture polysterene plate. The following 6 week culture process of the tested construct in the dynamic flow system led to massive cell proliferation with even distribution inside the scaffold. Subcutaneous implantation of the cultured construct into nude mice demonstrated good integration with the surrounding tissues and neovascularization."

Aspirin irreversibly binds cyclooxygenase-1, thereby reducing platelet aggregation for the lifetime of each platelet.

This increased aggregation persisted into the early postoperative period, but by 24 hours post operation aggregation had returned to near preoperative values.

Here, for the first time, it is demonstrated that αvβ3 is present in exosomes released from metastatic PC3 and CWR22Pc prostate cancer cells. Exosomal β3 is transferred as a protein from donor to nontumorigenic and tumorigenic cells as β3 protein or mRNA levels remain unaffected upon transcription or translation inhibition in recipient cells. Furthermore, it is shown that upon exosome uptake, de novo expression of an αvβ3 increases adhesion and migration of recipient cells on an αvβ3 ligand, vitronectin. To evaluate the relevance of these findings, exosomes were purified from the blood of TRAMP mice carrying tumors where the expression of αvβ3 is found higher than in exosomes from wild-type mice. In addition, it is demonstrated that αvβ3 is coexpressed with synaptophysin, a biomarker for aggressive neuroendocrine prostate cancer."

      "Here, we report that a nuclear sub-complex consisting of Hat1p and its partner Hat2p interacts physically and functionally with the origin recognition complex (ORC). While mutational inactivation of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) gene HAT1 alone does not compromise origin firing or initiation of DNA replication, a deletion in HAT1 (or HAT2) exacerbates the growth defects of conditional orc-ts mutants. Thus, the ORC-associated Hat1p-dependent histone acetyltransferase activity suggests a novel linkage between histone modification and DNA replication. Additional genetic and biochemical evidence points to the existence of partly overlapping histone H3 acetyltransferase activities in addition to Hat1p/Hat2p for proper DNA replication efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrated a dynamic association of Hat1p with chromatin during S-phase that suggests a role of this enzyme at the replication fork."

Two different CCK receptors (CCK1 and CCK2) have an opposite influence on the activity of dopamine neurons. Stimulation of CCK2 receptors decreases the release of dopamine and that receptor could mediate the neuroleptic-like effect of CCK.",

      "We used age- and sex-matched littermates in all our experiments. To evaluate the behavioural differences, we performed the rotarod test and measured the locomotor activity of animals using computer-connected photoelectric motility boxes. Amphetamine and apomorphine, two dopaminergic drugs with different pharmacodynamic properties, were used to influence the activity of the dopaminergic system in the brain. Neurochemical differences related to the different genotype were analysed by means of high-performance liquid chromatography and radioligand binding studies.",
      "Motor co-ordination was significantly impaired in the rotarod test of CCK2R receptor-deficient mice. Moreover, the locomotor activity of heterozygous (+/-) and homozygous (-/-) CCK2R receptor-deficient mice was somewhat reduced. A low dose of apomorphine (0.1 mg/kg), an unselective agonist of dopamine receptors, suppressed locomotor activity significantly more in homozygous (-/-) and heterozygous (+/-) mutant mice than in their wild-type (+/+) littermates. Amphetamine (3-6 mg/kg), increasing release of dopamine from the presynaptic terminals, caused a dose-dependent motor stimulation in wild-type (+/+) mice. In heterozygous (+/-) and homozygous (-/-) mice, a lower dose of amphetamine (3 mg/kg) did not alter the locomotor activity, whereas the higher dose of (6 mg/kg) induced a significantly stronger increase in locomotor activity in homozygous (-/-) mice than in their heterozygous (+/-) and wild-type (+/+) littermates. Despite the changes in the action of apomorphine and amphetamine in homozygous (-/-) mice, we did not find any significant differences in the concentration of dopamine and their metabolites in the striatum or cortex. However, the density of dopamine D2 receptors was significantly increased in the striatum of homozygous (-/-) animals compared with wild-type (+/+) mice."

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "The development of immunomonitoring models to determine HIV-1 vaccine efficacy is a major challenge. Studies suggest that HIV-1–specific CD8 T cells play a critical role in subjects achieving spontaneous viral control (HIV-1 controllers) and that they will be important in immune interventions. However, no single CD8 T-cell function is uniquely associated with controller status and the heterogeneity of responses targeting different epitopes further complicates the discovery of determinants of protective immunity. In the present study, we describe immunomonitoring models integrating multiple functions of epitope-specific CD8 T cells that distinguish controllers from subjects with treated or untreated progressive infection. Models integrating higher numbers of variables and trained with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) variant of logistic regression and 10-fold cross-validation produce “diagnostic tests” that display an excellent capacity to delineate subject categories. The test accuracy reaches 75% area under the receiving operating characteristic curve in cohorts matched for prevalence of protective alleles. Linear mixed-effects model analyses show that the proliferative capacity, cytokine production, and kinetics of cytokine secretion are associated with HIV-1 control. Although proliferative capacity is the strongest single discriminant, integrated modeling of different dimensions of data leverages individual associations. This strategy may have important applications in predictive model development and immune monitoring of HIV-1 vaccine trials."

Five TG2 peptide substrates that were predicted to bind to HLA-DQ2.5 did not contain previously characterized sequences of T-cell epitopes. Two of these peptides elicited T-cell responses when tested for recognition by intestinal T-cell lines of celiac disease patients, and thus they contain novel candidate T-cell epitopes. We also found that the intact 9mer core sequences of the respective epitopes were not present in all peptide substrates.

Apoptosis-associated DNA fragmentation was measured by agarose gel electrophoresis and propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Expression of BCL-2 family polypeptides was determined by immunoblotting.",
      "Non-metastatic PC-3P cells were significantly more sensitive to anoikis than the metastatic PC-3 variants (PC-3M, PC-3M-PRO-4, and PC-3M-LN-4), but anoikis resistance did not correlate with metastatic potential in LNCaP-derived cell lines. Expression of BCL-2 was higher in metastatic PC-3 and LNCaP subclones compared to isogenic non-metastatic cells, but these levels were not affected by anoikis. Enforced overexpression of BCL-2 did not protect either PC-3P or LNCaP-PRO-5 cells from anoikis, even though it rendered them resistant to thapsigargin and inhibited cytochrome c release. Strikingly, cells that died of anoikis maintained their pretreatment levels of BCL-2, whereas the cells that survived anoikis expressed much lower levels of the protein."

FoxO4(-/-) hearts had significantly fewer neutrophils, reduced expression of cytokines, and competitive nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Arg1. We generated conditional FoxO4 knockout mice with FoxO4 deleted in cardiac mycoytes or endothelial cells. FoxO4 endothelial cell-specific knockout mice showed significant post-MI improvement of cardiac function and reduction of neutrophil accumulation and cytokine expression, whereas FoxO4 cardiac mycoyte-specific knockout mice had no significant difference in cardiac function and post-MI inflammation from those of control littermates. FoxO4 binds the Foxo-binding site in the Arg1 promoter and activates Arg1 transcription. FoxO4 knockdown in human aortic endothelial cells upregulated nitric oxide on ischemia and suppressed monocyte adhesion that can be reversed by ectopic-expression of Arg1. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of Arg1 in wild-type mice had similar cardioprotection and reduced inflammation after MI as FoxO4 inactivation and administration of nitric oxide synthase inhibitor to FoxO4 KO mice reversed the beneficial effects of FoxO4 deletion on post-MI cardiac function."

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Targeted genomic enrichment (TGE) is a widely used method for isolating and enriching specific genomic regions prior to massively parallel sequencing. To make effective use of sequencer output, barcoding and sample pooling (multiplexing) after TGE and prior to sequencing (post-capture multiplexing) has become routine. While previous reports have indicated that multiplexing prior to capture (pre-capture multiplexing) is feasible, no thorough examination of the effect of this method has been completed on a large number of samples. Here we compare standard post-capture TGE to two levels of pre-capture multiplexing: 12 or 16 samples per pool. We evaluated these methods using standard TGE metrics and determined the ability to identify several classes of genetic mutations in three sets of 96 samples, including 48 controls. Our overall goal was to maximize cost reduction and minimize experimental time while maintaining a high percentage of reads on target and a high depth of coverage at thresholds required for variant detection.",
      "We adapted the standard post-capture TGE method for pre-capture TGE with several protocol modifications, including redesign of blocking oligonucleotides and optimization of enzymatic and amplification steps. Pre-capture multiplexing reduced costs for TGE by at least 38% and significantly reduced hands-on time during the TGE protocol. We found that pre-capture multiplexing reduced capture efficiency by 23 or 31% for pre-capture pools of 12 and 16, respectively. However efficiency losses at this step can be compensated by reducing the number of simultaneously sequenced samples. Pre-capture multiplexing and post-capture TGE performed similarly with respect to variant detection of positive control mutations. In addition, we detected no instances of sample switching due to aberrant barcode identification."

Ethanol induces apoptotic neuronal death at specific developmental stages, particularly during the brain-growth spurt, which occurs from the beginning of third trimester of gestation and continues for several years after birth in humans, whilst occurring in the first two postnatal weeks in mice. Administration of a single dose of ethanol in 7-d postnatal (P7) mice triggers activation of caspase-3 and widespread apoptotic neuronal death in the forebrain, providing a possible explanation for the microencephaly observed in human FAS. The present study was aimed at determining whether nicotinamide may prevent ethanol-induced neurodegeneration.",
      "P7 mice were treated with a single dose of ethanol (5 g/kg), and nicotinamide was administered from 0 h to 8 h after ethanol exposure. The effects of nicotinamide on ethanol-induced activation of caspase-3 and release of cytochrome-c from the mitochondria were analyzed by Western blot (n = 4-7/group). Density of Fluoro-Jade B-positive cells and NeuN-positive cells was determined in the cingulated cortex, CA1 region of the hippocampus, and lateral dorsal nucleus of the thalamus (n = 5-6/group). Open field, plus maze, and fear conditioning tests were used to study the behavior in adult mice (n = 31-34/group). Nicotinamide reduced the activation of caspase-3 (85.14 +/- 4.1%) and the release of cytochrome-c (80.78 +/- 4.39%) in postnatal mouse forebrain, too. Nicotinamide prevented also the ethanol-induced increase of apoptosis. We demonstrated that ethanol-exposed mice showed impaired performance in the fear conditioning test and increased activity in the open field and in the plus maze.

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Thrombomodulin, which is expressed solely on monocytes, along with tissue factor (TF), takes part in coagulation and inflammation. Circulating blood monocytes can be divided into 3 major subtypes on the basis of their receptor phenotype: classical (CD14brightCD16negative, CMs), inflammatory (CD14brightCD16positive; IMs), and dendritic cell-like (CD14dimCD16positive DMs). Monocyte subtype is strongly regulated, and the balance may influence the clinical outcomes of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Therefore, we investigated the phenotypic difference in thrombomodulin and TF expression between different monocyte subtypes in coagulopathy severity and prognosis in patients suspected of having DIC.",
      "In total, 98 patients suspected of having DIC were enrolled. The subtypes of circulating monocytes were identified using CD14 and CD16 and the thrombomodulin and TF expression in each subtype, expressed as mean fluorescence intensity, was measured by flow cytometry. Plasma level of tissue factor was measured by ELISA. In cultures of microbead-selected, CD14-positive peripheral monocytes, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or interleukin-10-induced expression profiles were analyzed, using flow cytometry.",
      "The proportion of monocyte subtypes did not significantly differ between the overt and non-overt DIC groups. The IM thrombomodulin expression level was prominent in the overt DIC group and was well correlated with other coagulation markers. Of note, IM thrombomodulin expression was found to be an independent prognostic marker in multivariate Cox regression analysis. In addition, in vitro culture of peripheral monocytes showed that LPS stimulation upregulated thrombomodulin expression and TF expression in distinct populations of monocytes."

Physicians perceive medical records as their work tool, written for communication within health care only. Considering effects on work environment, the physicians held a negative attitude and expected changes, which would affect their work processes in a negative way. Especially the fact that patients might read their test results before the physician was seen as possibly harmful for patients and as an interference with their established work practices. They expected the occurrence of misunderstandings and needs for additional explanations, which would consequently increase their workload. Other perceptions were that the portal would increase controlling and monitoring of physicians and increase or create a feeling of mistrust from patients. Regarding benefits for the patients, most of the physicians believe there is only little value in the patient portal and that patients would mostly be worried and misunderstand the information provided."

(2) The physicians' experiences were expressed as worries: patients would not understand the content of the record and become unnecessarily anxious from misunderstandings. The concerns are to some extent based on a generalized view of patients, which might disregard those, who already actively participate in health care. This study hence reveals a need to provide physicians with information about the values for patients from using patient portals.

To determine whether excess levels of ROS induce quiescence of hESC-derived CD34(+) cells, ROS levels were moderately reduced using selenium to enhance antioxidant activities of thioredoxin reductase and glutathione peroxidase. In comparison to untreated CD34(+) cells, selenium-treated CD34(+) cells exhibited changes in gene expression that favoured cell cycle progression, and had a greater proliferation and a smaller fraction of cells in G0 phase.

BV results were reported as percent deviation from the patient's ideal BV based on height and percent deviation from optimum weight. Hypovolemia was defined as less than 0%, euvolemia was defined as 0% to +16%, and hypervolemia was defined as greater than +16% deviation from ideal BV.

In addition, Cdc2 and Cyclin A cooperatively inhibit transcriptional activation by the essential S phase regulator E2F.

    "QUESTION": "Does calcarea carbonica induce apoptosis in cancer cells in p53-dependent manner via an immuno-modulatory circuit?",
    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Complementary medicines, including homeopathy, are used by many patients with cancer, usually alongside with conventional treatment. However, the molecular mechanisms underneath the anti-cancer effect, if any, of these medicines have still remained unexplored. To this end we attempted to evaluate the efficacy of calcarea carbonica, a homeopathic medicine, as an anti-cancer agent and to delineate the detail molecular mechanism(s) underlying calcerea carbonica-induced tumor regression.",
      "To investigate and delineate the underlying mechanisms of calcarea carbonica-induced tumor regression, Trypan blue dye-exclusion test, flow cytometric, Western blot and reverse transcriptase-PCR techniques were employed. Further, siRNA transfections and inhibitor studies were used to validate the involvement of p53 pathway in calcarea carbonica-induced apoptosis in cancer cells.",
      "Interestingly, although calcarea carbonica administration to Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma (EAC)- and Sarcoma-180 (S-180)-bearing Swiss albino mice resulted in 30-35% tumor cell apoptosis, it failed to induce any significant cell death in ex vivo conditions. These results prompted us to examine whether calcarea carbonica employs the immuno-modulatory circuit in asserting its anti-tumor effects. Calcarea carbonica prevented tumor-induced loss of effector T cell repertoire, reversed type-2 cytokine bias and attenuated tumor-induced inhibition of T cell proliferation in tumor-bearing host. To confirm the role of immune system in calcarea carbonica-induced cancer cell death, a battery of cancer cells were co-cultured with calcarea carbonica-primed T cells. Our results indicated a \"two-step\" mechanism of the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells by calcarea carbonica i.e., (1) activation of the immune system of the host; and (2) induction of cancer cell apoptosis via immuno-modulatory circuit in p53-dependent manner by down-regulating Bcl-2:Bax ratio. Bax up-regulation resulted in mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss and cytochrome c release followed by activation of caspase cascade. Knocking out of p53 by RNA-interference inhibited calcarea carbonica-induced apoptosis thereby confirming the contribution of p53."

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is associated with diabetes and may be related to the development of hypertension, ischemic stroke, and a number of other late complications. The earliest sign of CAN is a reduction of heart rate variability (HRV). Standard HRV tests for CAN include expiration-to-inspiration ratio, response to active standing (30:15), and the Valsalva maneuver. Because of the technical requirements for these tests, they are limited to the point-of-care office or a clinical laboratory setting. It is unknown if a \"white-coat\" phenomenon exists in autonomic neuropathy testing and if home testing is feasible. The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the reproducibility of CAN testing in a clinical setting, (2) to evaluate the feasibility of self-monitoring of cardiovascular autonomic function at home, and (3) report possible differences in measurements taken at the hospital versus those taken at home.",
      "Ten healthy subjects were included. Participants underwent in-hospital testing for CAN before and after home monitoring. For 6 consecutive days, participants measured autonomic function once a day at home. The intra- and interindividual reproducibility was determined by coefficient of variation (CV) and the reproducibility coefficient (RC). Agreement between hospital and home testing was analyzed using Pearson r, mean difference, and Bland-Altman analysis with Pitman's test of difference in variance.",
      "Pitman's test showed no significant difference in variance between hospital and home measurements, indicating suitable agreement between the two measurements. Reproducibility was moderate to high in all measures, with RC ranging from 66-94% and CV ranging from 5-10%."

      "For pretargeting and other nuclear medicine applications, it may eventually be useful to radiolabel phosphodiamidate morpholinos (MORFs) with therapeutic radionuclides such as 188Re. However, by preparing 188Re-MORFs labelled conventionally with MAG3 as chelator, we have observed unacceptable levels of oxidation to perrhenate in vitro and in vivo in mice.",
      "To improve upon stability, tricarbonyl labelling was considered since tricarbonyl complexes are thought to stabilize metals in low oxidation states.",
      "An amine derivatized 25 mer MORF was conjugated with either NHS-MAG3 or NHS-Hynic. The MAG3 conjugated MORF was radiolabelled conventionally with 188Re while the Hynic conjugated MORF was radiolabelled through its tricarbonyl intermediate. Using a commercial kit modified with additional reducing agent over that required for the preparation of the 99mTc tricarbonyl complex [99mTc(CO)3(H2O)3]+, we demonstrated that the equivalent 188Re tricarbonyl, [188Re(CO)3(H2O)3]+, could be prepared. Simple incubation at elevated temperatures with the Hynic conjugated MORF then provided 188Re-(CO)3-Hynic-MORF. Confirmation was achieved by a shift assay using a complementary MORF conjugated polymer and size exclusion HPLC. To evaluate the relative stability of the tricarbonyl labelled MORF compared to the MAG3 labelled MORF in vitro, the radiolabelled MORFs were incubated in phosphate buffer and the presence of perrhenate measured periodically by strip chromatography. Stability in vivo was evaluated by biodistribution studies in normal mice.",
      "The overall yields for tricarbonyl intermediates averaged greater than 90% for 99mTc and 60-80% for 188Re. Yields following subsequent labelling to Hynic-MORF were about 60-80% for 99mTc and 15-20% for 188Re. The in vitro stability results in phosphate buffer showed that 188Re-MAG3-MORF was fully oxidized by 48 h while 188Re-(CO)3-Hynic-MORF was less than 20% oxidized at that time. Similarly, the 188Re-(CO)3-Hynic-MORF biodistribution in normal mice showed lower radioactivity level in stomach, intestines and thyroid compared with 188Re-MAG3-MORF."

Besides the efficacy against a broad range of strains, phages have to be safe in terms of their genomes. Thus far, no genes with pathogenic potential (e.g., genes encoding virulence factors) have been detected in Campylobacter phages. However, preliminary studies suggested that the genomes of group II phages may be diverse and prone to genomic rearrangements.",
      "We determined and analysed the genomic sequence (182,761 bp) of group II phage CP21 that is closely related to the already characterized group II phages CP220 and CPt10. The genomes of these phages are comprised of four modules separated by very similar repeat regions, some of which harbouring open reading frames (ORFs). Though, the arrangement of the modules and the location of some ORFs on the genomes are different in CP21 and in CP220/CPt10. In this work, a PCR system was established to study the modular genome organization of other group II phages demonstrating that they belong to different subgroups of the CP220-like virus genus, the prototypes of which are CP21 and CP220. The subgroups revealed different restriction patterns and, interestingly enough, also distinct host specificities, tail fiber proteins and tRNA genes. We additionally analysed the genome of group II phage vB_CcoM-IBB_35 (IBB_35) for which to date only five individual contigs could be determined. We show that the contigs represent modules linked by long repeat regions enclosing some yet not identified ORFs (e.g., for a head completion protein).

These data indicate that lipid accumulation within the mesangial cell interferes with the signal transduction response to IGFBP-5.

One-week treatment with liraglutide (30 µg/kg twice daily) did not reduce body weight, but reversed insulin resistance, cardiac tumor necrosis factor-α expression, nuclear factor kappa B translocation, obesity-induced perturbations in cardiac endothelial nitric oxide synthase, connexin-43, and markers of hypertrophy and fibrosis, in comparison with placebo-treated HFD controls. Liraglutide improved the cardiac endoplasmic reticulum stress response and also improved cardiac function in animals on HFD by an AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent mechanism.

Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs), including the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors (FGFRs) are also important in development and disease. However, a direct relationship between growth factor signaling pathways and NFκB activation has not been previously described, although FGFs have been known to antagonize TNFα-induced apoptosis.",

This novel interaction was identified utilizing a yeast two-hybrid screen [1] and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis. We demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation of IKKβ in the presence of activated FGFR4, but not kinase-dead FGFR4. Following stimulation by TNFα (Tumor Necrosis Factor α) to activate NFκB pathways, FGFR4 activation results in significant inhibition of NFκB signaling as measured by decreased nuclear NFκB localization, by reduced NFκB transcriptional activation in electophoretic mobility shift assays, and by inhibition of IKKβ kinase activity towards the substrate GST-IκBα in in vitro assays. FGF19 stimulation of endogenous FGFR4 in TNFα-treated DU145 prostate cancer cells also leads to a decrease in IKKβ activity, concomitant reduction in NFκB nuclear localization, and reduced apoptosis. Microarray analysis demonstrates that FGF19 + TNFα treatment of DU145 cells, in comparison with TNFα alone, favors proliferative genes while downregulating genes involved in apoptotic responses and NFκB signaling."

IL-1β induction of Dkk-1 increased expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), angiogenic factors, ADAMTS-5, and MMP-3 in synovial fibroblasts and promoted angiogenesis in vascular endothelial cells. Knockdown of HIF-1α decreased Dkk-1 enhancement of angiogenic factor expression. Stabilization of glycogen synthase kinase 3β phosphorylated at Ser(9) , β-catenin, T cell factor 4, and ERK signaling attenuated Dkk-1 up-regulation of angiogenic factor and proteinase expression in synovial fibroblasts.

Ouabain also increased the Na/K-ATPase content in both early and late endosomes, activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K), and also caused a translocation of some Na/K-ATPase to the nucleus. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that the Na/K-ATPase colocalized with clathrin both before and after exposure to ouabain, and immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that ouabain stimulated interactions among the Na/K-ATPase, adaptor protein-2 (AP-2), and clathrin. Potassium (K) depletion, chlorpromazine, or PI(3)K inhibition all significantly attenuated this ouabain-induced endocytosis. Inhibition of the ouabain-activated signaling process through Src by 4-Amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) significantly attenuated ouabain-induced endocytosis.

The zone of acetylcholine receptor alpha mRNA distribution was broader and excess sprouting of motor nerve terminals was more prominent in meltrin beta-deficient than in wild-type embryonic diaphragms. A microarray analysis revealed that the preferential distribution of ephrin-A5 mRNA in the synaptic region of muscles was aberrant in the meltrin beta-deficient muscles. Excess sprouting of motor nerve terminals was also found in ephrin-A5 knockout mice, which lead us to investigate a possible link between Meltrin beta and ephrin-A5-Eph signaling in the development of the NMJ. Meltrin beta and EphA4 interacted with each other in developing motor neurons, and both of these proteins localized in the NMJ. Coexpression of Meltrin beta and EphA4 strongly blocked vesicular internalization of ephrin-A5-EphA4 complexes without requiring the protease activity of Meltrin beta, suggesting a regulatory role of Meltrin beta in ephrin-A5-Eph signaling."

PMNs were isolated and superoxide anion (O(-)(2)) generation (nmol O(-)(2)/3.75 x 10(5) PMNs/min) was measured by reduction of cytochrome c after exposure to fMLP, C5a, or PMA; elastase release (% total PMN elastase content) was measured by cleavage of AAPV-pNA after exposure to fMLP or C5a.",

Significant PMN priming for O(-)(2) production was discovered at 3, 6, and 12 h following CPB and for elastase release at 3 and 6 h after CPB. At 2 to 3 days after CPB, O(-)(2) generation was significantly less than that of the preoperative control. Neutrophil primability with PAF was detected at 6 h after CPB. A similar defect in PAF-primable O(-)(2) production was seen 2 and 3 days post-CPB.

As the mechanisms involved in the intracellular regulation of HSF1 in good health and its dysregulation in disease are still incomplete we are investigating the role of posttranslational modifications in such regulation.",

HSF1 binds avidly to the catalytic subunit of PKA, (PKAcα) and becomes phosphorylated on a novel serine phosphorylation site within its central regulatory domain (serine 320 or S320), both in vitro and in vivo. Intracellular PKAcα levels and phosphorylation of HSF1 at S320 were both required for HSF1 to be localized to the nucleus, bind to response elements in the promoter of an HSF1 target gene (hsp70.1) and activate hsp70.1 after stress. Reduction in PKAcα levels by small hairpin RNA led to HSF1 exclusion from the nucleus, its exodus from the hsp70.1 promoter and decreased hsp70.1 transcription. Likewise, null mutation of HSF1 at S320 by alanine substitution for serine led to an HSF1 species excluded from the nucleus and deficient in hsp70.1 activation."

      "The present work introduces two different Wavelet Transform (WT) applications to electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of patients in AF. The first one predicts spontaneous termination of paroxysmal AF (PAF), whereas the second one deals with the prediction of electrical cardioversion (ECV) outcome in persistent AF patients. In both cases, the central tendency measure (CTM) from the first differences scatter plot was applied to the AF wavelet decomposition. In this way, the wavelet coefficients vector CTM associated to the AF frequency scale was used to assess how atrial fibrillatory (f) waves variability can be related to AF events.",
      "Structural changes into the f waves can be assessed by combining WT and CTM to reflect atrial activity organization variation. This fact can be used to predict organization-related events in AF. To this respect, results in the prediction of PAF termination regarding sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 100%, 91.67% and 96%, respectively. On the other hand, for ECV outcome prediction, 82.93% sensitivity, 90.91% specificity and 85.71% accuracy were obtained. Hence, CTM has reached the highest diagnostic ability as a single predictor published to date."

      "On circumferential profile analysis, PET ischemia was defined by preserved glucose metabolism in hypoperfused myocardium, and PET infarction was defined by concordant reductions in perfusion and metabolism. On 19 stress-redistribution and seven rest-redistribution SPECT studies, four observers visually scored 201Tl activity in eight segments on a scale from 0 (normal) to 3 (complete defect). Using an improvement in visual score > or = 0.75 to define redistribution, there were 100 fixed, 17 partially reversible, and 12 completely reversible defects. PET identified tissue metabolic activity in 51 (51%) segments with fixed defects (21 PET ischemia, 30 PET normal) and nine (53%) segments with partially reversible defects (five PET ischemia, four PET normal). When grouped by 24-hour score, the proportion of fixed defects with metabolic activity varied from 84% (scores < or = 1.4) to 15% (scores > 2.6). For partially reversible defects, only 53% with scores < 2.0 and one of two with scores > or = 2.0 were considered metabolically viable on PET. Of 12 completely reversible defects, six (50%) were normal, five (42%) had PET ischemia, and one (8%) had PET infarction.

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Non-invasive diffuse optical tomography (DOT) and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) can detect and characterize breast cancer and predict tumor responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, even in patients with radiographically dense breasts. However, the relationship between measured optical parameters and pathological biomarker information needs to be further studied to connect information from optics to traditional clinical cancer biology. Thus we investigate how optically measured physiological parameters in malignant tumors such as oxy-, deoxy-hemoglobin concentration, tissue blood oxygenation, and metabolic rate of oxygen correlate with microscopic histopathological biomarkers from the same malignant tumors, e.g., Ki67 proliferation markers, CD34 stained vasculature markers and nuclear morphology.",

In a subset of the Ki67-negative group (defined by the 15 % threshold), an inverse correlation between Ki67 expression level and mammary metabolic rate of oxygen was observed (R = -0.95, p-value: 0.014). Further, CD34 stained mean-vessel-area in tumor is positively correlated with tumor-to-normal total-hemoglobin and oxy-hemoglobin concentration. Finally, we find that cell nuclei tend to have more elongated shapes in less oxygenated DOT-measured environments."

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "During pathogen infection, innate immunity is initiated via the recognition of microbial products by pattern recognition receptors and the subsequent activation of transcription factors that upregulate proinflammatory genes. By controlling the expression of cytokines, chemokines, anti-bacterial peptides and adhesion molecules, the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) has a central function in this process. In a typical model of NF-κB activation, the recognition of pathogen associated molecules triggers the canonical NF-κB pathway that depends on the phosphorylation of Inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) by the catalytic subunit IκB kinase β (IKKβ), its degradation and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB dimers.",
      "Here, we performed an RNA interference (RNAi) screen on Shigella flexneri-induced NF-κB activation to identify new factors involved in the regulation of NF-κB following infection of epithelial cells by invasive bacteria. By targeting a subset of the human signaling proteome, we found that the catalytic subunit IKKα is also required for complete NF-κB activation during infection. Depletion of IKKα by RNAi strongly reduces the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 during S. flexneri infection as well as the expression of the proinflammatory chemokine interleukin-8. Similar to IKKβ, IKKα contributes to the phosphorylation of IκBα on serines 32 and 36, and to its degradation. Experiments performed with the synthetic Nod1 ligand L-Ala-D-γ-Glu-meso-diaminopimelic acid confirmed that IKKα is involved in NF-κB activation triggered downstream of Nod1-mediated peptidoglycan recognition."

Gabapentin also increased activity of channels mutated at phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2))-binding sites (R188Q, R217A and K218A). However, gabapentin failed to enhance channel activity in the presence of protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors and did not activate phosphorylation site mutants (S44A, S219A or S313A), mutants that mimicked the negative charge carried by a phosphate group bound to a serine (S44D, S219D or S313D), or a mutated channel with a positive charge (S219R). These findings show that gabapentin activates ROMK1 channels independently of the pH(i) and not via a PIP(2)-dependent pathway.

In mammals, DR signalling is mediated by the recruitment of several DD (death domain)-containing molecules, such as FADD (Fas-associated DD) and RIP1 (receptor-interacting protein 1).",
      "To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of intracellular DR signalling in Xenopus, we have isolated cDNAs encoding xFADD (Xenopus FADD), and xRIP1 and its short isoform xRIP1beta, which is produced by alternative splicing of the xRIP1 gene. These DD-containing proteins interacted with Xenopus DR members xDR-M1 and xDR-M2 through their DDs in co-transfected HEK-293T cells. Overexpression of xFADD activated not only xCaspase 8, but also AP-1 (activator protein 1), which reflects activation of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB). A comparative analysis of xRIP1, a kinase-dead mutant of xRIP1 and xRIP1beta indicated that the kinase activity of xRIP1 was required for the activation of AP-1 and NF-kappaB. Interestingly, xFADD and xRIP1 interacted with each other via their DDs, and the expression of a mutant xRIP1 containing only the DD (xRIP1-DD) repressed the xFADD-induced activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1. xFADD and xRIP1 synergistically induced the activation of AP-1 and NF-kappaB, both of which were partially mediated by TRAF2 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 2) and TAK1 (transforming-growth-factor-beta-activated kinase 1).

RESULTS Group I serum leptin levels declined during the day in both men and women regardless of whether alcohol or water had been administered in the morning. Since leptin levels in general were markedly higher in women than in men, all leptin changes after water/alcohol were transformed to percentage changes to make them comparable between sexes. When the percentage leptin decline over a 6-h period (08.00-24.00 hours) was expressed by a decremental area under curve (AUC08-14), it became evident that alcohol inhibited leptin secretion, inasmuch as the leptin decremental area, obtained after alcohol, was significantly larger than the one obtained after water (124 +/- 17 vs. 57 +/- 8; P < 0.01). Similar insulin and glucose levels were obtained after alcohol and water. Group II serum leptin levels increased after both alcohol and water during the initial part of the night (18.00-20.00 hours). In this period alcohol inhibited the secretion of leptin as shown by the leptin incremental area (AUC18-24) which was 53 +/- 18 after alcohol and 113 +/- 15 after water (P < 0.01). As the ethanol concentration in serum began to fall, its inhibitory effect on leptin gradually disappeared, and when leptin AUCs representing the entire night were determined after alcohol and water, they were not significantly different. Similar insulin, glucose, testosterone, IGF-1 and cortisol levels were found after alcohol and water.

Adiposity was indexed with body mass index SD scores relative to British 1990 norms; for some analyses, children were categorized into groups of overweight or obese and into 2 subgroups of normal-weight (lower normal-weight or higher normal-weight) for comparison of the eating rate within the normal range as well as between clinical and nonclinical groups. All analyses controlled for clustering in twin pairs. Heritability of eating rate was modeled by using standard twin methods.",
      "There was a significant linear association across the 3 weight groups for eating rate (P = 0.010), and regression analyses showed that eating rate increased by 0.18 bites/min for each 1-unit increase in body mass index SD score (P = 0.005). The heritability of eating rate was high (0.62; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.74). There was no association between weight group and a change (ie, deceleration) in eating rate over the mealtime."

      "Pulmonary infection of humans by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), results in active disease in 5-10% of individuals, while asymptomatic latent Mtb infection (LTBI) is established in the remainder. The host immune responses that determine this differential outcome following Mtb infection are not fully understood. Using a rabbit model of pulmonary TB, we have shown that infection with the Mtb clinical isolate HN878 (a hyper-virulent W-Beijing lineage strain) leads to progressive cavitary disease similar to what is seen in humans with active TB. In contrast, infection with Mtb CDC1551 (a hyper-immunogenic clinical isolate) is efficiently controlled in rabbit lungs, with establishment of LTBI, which can be reactivated upon treatment with immune-suppressive drugs. We hypothesize that the initial interaction of Mtb with the cells of the host response in the lungs determine later outcome of infection.",
      "To test this hypothesis, we used our rabbit model of pulmonary TB and infected the animals with Mtb HN878 or CDC1551. At 3 hours, with similar lung bacillary loads, HN878 infection caused greater accumulation of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the lungs, compared to animals infected with CDC1551. Using whole-genome microarray gene expression analysis, we delineated the early transcriptional changes in the lungs of HN878- or CDC1551-infected rabbits at this time and compared them to the differential response at 4 weeks of Mtb-infection. Our gene network and pathway analysis showed that the most significantly differentially expressed genes involved in the host response to HN878, compared to CDC1551, at 3 hours of infection, were components of the inflammatory response and STAT1 activation, recruitment and activation of macrophages, PMN, and fMLP (N-formyl-Methionyl-Leucyl-Phenylalanine)-stimulation. At 4 weeks, the CDC1551 bacillary load was significantly lower and the granulomatous response reduced compared to HN878 infection. Moreover, although inflammation was dampened in both Mtb infections at 4 weeks, the majority of the differentially expressed gene networks were similar to those seen at 3 hours."

In the present study, a selective GABAA alpha5 benzodiazepine inverse agonist (e.g., RY 023) was used in a series of in vivo and in vitro studies to determine the significance of the alpha5-receptor in the neurobehavioral actions of alcohol.",
      "In experiment one, systemic injections of RY 023 (1 to 10 mg/kg IP) dose-dependently reduced ethanol-maintained responding by 52% to 86% of controls, whereas bilateral hippocampal infusions (0.3 to 20 microg) reduced responding by 66% to 84% of controls. Saccharin responding was reduced only with the highest intraperitoneal (e.g., 10 mg) and microinjected (e.g., 20 microg) doses. In experiment two, RY 023 (3.0 to 15 mg/kg IP) reversed the motor-impairing effects of a moderate dose of alcohol (0.75 g/kg) on an oscillating bar task in the absence of intrinsic effects. In the open field, RY 023 (3.0 to 7.5 mg/kg) produced intrinsic effects alone but attenuated the suppression of the 1.25 g/kg ethanol dose. Because the diazepam-insensitive receptors (e.g., alpha4 and alpha6) have been suggested to play a role in alcohol motor impairing and sedative actions, experiment three compared the efficacy of RY 023 with Ro 15-4513 and two prototypical benzodiazepine antagonists (e.g., flumazenil and ZK 93426) across the alpha4beta3gamma2-, alpha5beta3gamma2-, and alpha6beta3gamma2-receptor subtypes in Xenopus oocytes.",

To start elucidating the molecular underpinnings of neonatal cardiac fibrosis, we investigated Wnt signaling in the neonatal heart after cryoinjury.",

In addition, we showed that-similar to adult ischemic injury-neonatal cryoinjury results in activation of Wnt signaling in cardiac fibroblasts near injured areas. Furthermore, through in situ hybridization of all 19 Wnt ligands in injured neonatal hearts, we observed upregulation of Wnt ligands (Wnt2b, Wnt5a, and Wnt9a) that had not been implicated in the adult cardiac injury response."

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Urine-derived stem cells (USCs) have the ability to differentiate into osteogenic lineage. Previous studies have raised the possibility that USCs could be used for bone repair. To harness the power of USCs in promoting bone regeneration, methods must be developed to induce USCs to osteogenic lineage efficiently. The present study investigates the effect of lentivirus-encoded bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) gene transduction on the osteogenic potential of USCs.",
      "USCs were isolated from voided urine and transduced with Lentiviral vector encoding BMP2. An in vitro study was performed to detect Lentiviral-BMP2 transduced USCs differentiated towards osteogenic lineage. Furthermore, Lentiviral-BMP2 transduced USCs were transplanted in vivo to examine the ectopic bone formation ability. After six weeks, retrieval samples were obtained for immunostaining and histological analysis.",
      "The results showed that the transduction efficiencies were over 90%, and transduced USCs had high expression levels of the BMP2 gene and secreted BMP2 protein. Alkaline activity and mineral deposition staining demonstrated that transduced USCs differentiate into osteogenic lineages without the addition of osteogenic supplements. Transduced USCs also showed high expression of bone-related markers, including runt-related protein-2 (Runx2) and osteocalcin (OCN), confirming this lentiviral-BMP2 construct provides sufficient stimuli for osteogenic differentiation. Histological analysis indicated that the transduced USCs induced robust new bone formation in nude mice. Six weeks after transplantation, human derived cells were observed to participate in bone formation."

Nicotinamide also increased the synthesis of glucosylceramide (7.4-fold) and sphingomyelin (3.1-fold) in the same concentration range effective for ceramide synthesis. Furthermore, the activity of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in sphingolipid synthesis, was increased in nicotinamide-treated cells. Nicotinamide increased the levels of human LCB1 and LCB2 mRNA, both of which encode subunits of SPT. This suggested that the increase in SPT activity was due to an increase in SPT mRNA. Nicotinamide increased not only ceramide synthesis but also free fatty acid (2.3-fold) and cholesterol synthesis (1.5-fold). Topical application of nicotinamide increased ceramide and free fatty acid levels in the stratum corneum, and decreased transepidermal water loss in dry skin."

Moreover, Western blot analysis of exogenous gene expression (driven by the human elongation factor 1 α subunit promoter) in transiently transfected cells revealed that triptolide specifically reduces the steady-state level of Tat protein, without suppressing global gene expression. Further studies showed that triptolide accelerates Tat protein degradation, which can be rescued by administration of the proteasome inhibitor MG132.

We further demonstrate that 9AA activates caspase-3/7 resulting in PARP cleavage. Next we investigated the efficacy of 9AA in the MET-1 ATL model. Alone, 9AA did not cause significant drops in surrogate tumor markers, soluble IL-2Rα or β2-micorglobulin (β2μ) levels with only a slight increase in survival of MET-1-bearing mice. However, in combination with Campath-1H, 9AA treatment resulted in low soluble IL-2Rα and β2μ levels at 2 and 4 weeks. Consistent with reduced tumor cell burden, combination treatment significantly increased survival of MET-1-bearing mice compared to mice treated with either drug alone. Splenic cells isolated from 9AA or combination treated mice showed increased p53 protein levels and transcriptional activity. Consistent with increased tumor suppressor activity, we found increased PARP-1 cleavage in 9AA and combination treated cells."

      "The mesothelium has an important role in maintaining an adequate fibrinolytic capacity in the peritoneal cavity and thus in preventing the formation of fibrinous peritoneal adhesions by secreting the fibrinolytic enzyme tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). The fibrinolytic activity of human mesothelial cells (HMCs) is counteracted by rapid uptake of t-PA via the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). The 39 kD receptor-associated protein (RAP) is an inhibitor of binding of t-PA to LRP, but RAP itself is also rapidly degraded via LRP.",
      "Adenovirus-mediated RAP gene transfer technology was used to evaluate the effect of prolonged overexpression of RAP on t-PA accumulation in conditioned medium of HMCs under basal and inflammatory conditions.",
      "Infection of HMCs with a recombinant adenovirus carrying the RAP cDNA resulted within one day in t-PA levels that were maximally twofold to threefold increased as compared with noninfected or adenovirus-beta-galactosidase-infected cells. Whereas upon prolonged incubation, t-PA levels in the conditioned medium of uninfected cells leveled off because of rapid uptake and degradation via LRP, t-PA concentrations in the medium of adenovirus-RAP-infected cells continued to increase, reaching fivefold control levels after 72 hours. The increased t-PA accumulation persisted for seven days and then slowly returned to control values over the next few weeks. In contrast, the production of a specific inhibitor of t-PA, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), was not affected by adenoviral RAP gene transfer. Northern blotting analysis showed that t-PA, PAI-1, and LRP mRNA concentrations were not changed after adenoviral infection, underlining that the elevated t-PA levels are the result of RAP-blocked uptake and degradation of t-PA rather than increased t-PA synthesis. RAP gene transfer also restored diminished fibrinolytic activity of cytokine-treated mesothelial cells."

This process is aided by the local expression of chemokines, which furnish these cells with directional cues that augment their migration to areas of retinal injury. While these qualities make chemokines a potential therapeutic target in curtailing damaging retinal inflammation, their wide variety and signalling redundancy pose challenges in broadly modulating their activity. Here, we examine the efficacy of the broad-spectrum chemokine inhibitor NR58-3.14.3-a suppressor of Ccl- and Cxcl- chemokine pathways-in suppressing macrophage activity and photoreceptor death, using a light-induced model of outer retinal atrophy and inflammation.",

Prior to damage, NR58-3.14.3 was injected intravitreally. Retinas were harvested and evaluated for the effect of NR58-3.14.3 on subretinal macrophage accumulation and cytokine expression profile, as well as photoreceptor degeneration.",

There was a close relationship between the total mass of tissue TfR and the total mass of serum sTfR (r = 0.79, p < 0.0001). Serum sTfR represented approximately 5-6% of the total mass of tissue TfR in most experimental situations, but this ratio was twice as high during iron-restricted erythropoiesis.

Adding radiologic imaging to the prediction model improved the discriminative ability substantially (c-statistic, 0.81). Adding tonometry to the prediction model further improved the discriminative ability of the model (c-statistic, 0.90). The combination of clinical features and tonometry with a c-statistic of 0.88 approximated the discriminative ability of the latter model."

Elevation in transendothelial albumin permeability, which was induced by administration of a calpain inhibitor (ALLM), was prominent in the inferior arch; moreover, this elevation was abolished by Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (Y-27632). Similarly, short interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced silencing of m-calpain resulted in increased RhoA activity and hyperpermeability in the aortic arch, which was accompanied by ROCK inhibitor-sensitive phosphorylation of downstream effecter LIM kinase 2 (LIMK2), stress fibre accumulation in endothelium and enhanced interendothelial gaps. Exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to LF diminished RhoA activity; in contrast, DF facilitated the activity. siRNA-induced m-calpain silencing further accelerated the DF-induced RhoA overactivation, phosphorylation of LIMK2, and cytoskeletal rearrangement, resulting in barrier dysfunction in the cells."

The same effects were observed on ECM-dependent cellular migration and cell attachment to the ECM. The expression levels of the major α and β integrin subunits, and of E-cadherin, were found to be similar to those observed in the non-transfected control cells, whereas talin1 expression was found to be increased after TPD54 knock-down.

Additionally, ischemia/reperfusion resulted in higher nonparenchymal cell-dependent induction of oxidative stress and stronger inflammation in NEMODeltaLPC mice. This led to massive hepatocyte apoptosis and death of the animals, while NEMO(f/f) mice survived with significantly lesser liver damage, showing mainly necrotic cell death.

Next, we examined the relation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by Dox to the expression of FLIP. Both of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and the combination of superoxide dismutase and catalase restored the decreased FLIP in Dox-treated cardiac myocytes to the basal level. NAC also restored the increased formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance after Dox-treatment. Concurrently, the susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis disappeared with the treatments of the antioxidant agents. Hydrogen peroxide down-regulated FLIP in a dose-dependent fashion and also sensitized cardiac myocytes to Fas-induced apoptosis."

      "We measured the effects of proadifen and adiphenine on single-channel and macroscopic currents of adult mouse muscle AChR (wild-type and mutant). We assessed the results in terms of mechanisms and sites of action.",
      "Both proadifen and adiphenine decreased the frequency of ACh-induced single-channel currents. Proadifen did not change cluster properties, but adiphenine decreased cluster duration (36-fold at 100 micromolxL(-1)). Preincubation with proadifen decreased the amplitude (IC(50)= 19 micromolxL(-1)) without changing the decay rate of macroscopic currents. In contrast, adiphenine did not change amplitude but increased the decay rate (IC(50)= 15 micromolxL(-1)). Kinetic measurements demonstrate that proadifen acts on the resting state to induce a desensitized state whose kinetics of recovery resemble those of ACh-induced desensitization. Adiphenine accelerates desensitization from the open state, but previous application of the drug to resting receptors is required. Both drugs stabilize desensitized states, as evidenced by the decrease in the number of clusters elicited by high ACh concentrations. The inhibition by adiphenine is not affected by proadifen, and the mutation alphaE262K decreases the sensitivity of the AChR only for adiphenine, indicating that these drugs act at different sites."

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "In addition to the regulation of blood pressure, alpha2- and beta-adrenoceptor (AR) subtypes play an important role in the modulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission in the human CNS and PNS. Several studies suggest that the alpha2-AR responsiveness in cells and tissues after chronic epinephrine (EPI) or norepinephrine (NE) exposure may vary, depending on the beta-AR activity present there. Recently, we reported that in BE(2)-C human neuroblastoma cells (endogenously expressing alpha2A- and beta2-AR), chronic EPI treatment (300 nM) produced a dramatic beta-adrenoceptor-dependent desensitization of the alpha2A-AR response. The aim of this study is to determine if stable addition of a beta2-AR to a second neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), that normally expresses only alpha2A-ARs that are not sensitive to 300 nM EPI exposure, would suddenly render alpha2A-ARs in that cell line sensitive to treatment with the same EPI concentration.",
      "These studies employed RT-PCR, receptor binding and inhibition of cAMP accumulation to confirm alpha2-AR subtype expression. Stable clones of SH-SY5Y cells transfected to stably express functional beta2-ARs (SHbeta2AR4) were selected to compare sensitivity of alpha2-AR to EPI in the presence or absence of beta2-ARs.",
      "A series of molecular, biochemical and pharmacological studies indicated that the difference between the cell lines could not be attributed to alpha2-AR heterogeneity. We now report that after transfection of functional beta2-AR into SH-SY5Y cells (SHbeta2AR4), chronic treatment with modest levels of EPI desensitizes the alpha2A-AR. This effect results from a beta2-AR dependent down-regulation of native alpha2A-ARs by EPI accompanied by enhanced translocation of GRK2 and GRK3 to the membrane (required for GRK-mediated phosphorylation of agonist-occupied receptors)."

Therefore, in this study, we extended this in vitro findings to in vivo settings in order to establish a proof of concept that inhibition of GSK-3 activity is feasible in suppressing tumor growth of prostate cancer in vivo.",

The autochthonous transgenic prostate cancer TRAMP mice were used for testing GSK-3 inhibitor's effect on tumor development. Anti-Ki-67 and BrdU immunohistochemistry was used to determine cell proliferation. The pE2F-TA-LUC (E2F-LUC) luciferase reporter assay and gene specific small interferencing RNA technique were used to examine C/EBP involvement in GSK-3 inhibitor-induced E2F-1 suppression.",

Consistent with our previous in vitro findings, GSK-3 inhibitors significantly reduced BrdU incorporation and Ki67-positive cells in xenograft tumors and mouse cancerous prostates compared to the control. Further analysis revealed that following GSK-3 inhibition, C/EBPα, a negative cell cycle regulator, was remarkably accumulated in xenograft tumors or in cultured prostate cancer cells.

For comparison, a group of fetuses without diaphragmatic hernia were subjected to prolonged tracheal ligation (TL; 4-week tracheal ligation, n = 3). Unoperated littermates (n = 8) were used as controls (CTR). All were killed near term. Lung tissue was processed for light and electron microscopy (computerized stereologic morphometry).

The aim of this study was to investigate whether an atherogenic (Ath) diet induces the pathology of steatohepatitis necessary for the diagnosis of human NASH and how cholesterol and triglyceride alter the hepatic gene expression profiles responsible for oxidative stress. We investigated the liver pathology and plasma and hepatic lipids of mice fed the Ath diet. The hepatic gene expression profile was examined with microarrays and real-time polymerase chain reactions. The Ath diet induced dyslipidemia, lipid peroxidation, and stellate cell activation in the liver and finally caused precirrhotic steatohepatitis after 24 weeks. Cellular ballooning, a necessary histological feature defining human NASH, was observed in contrast to existing animal models. The addition of a high-fat component to the Ath diet caused hepatic insulin resistance and further accelerated the pathology of steatohepatitis. A global gene expression analysis revealed that the Ath diet up-regulated the hepatic expression levels of genes for fatty acid synthesis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrogenesis, which were further accelerated by the addition of a high-fat component. Conversely, the high-fat component down-regulated the hepatic gene expression of antioxidant enzymes and might have increased oxidative stress."

In contrast to all previously described mutations in ABCC2 genes that directly or indirectly affect the extracellular domains of the membrane protein, the ABCC2 mutation found in S. exigua affects an intracellular domain involved in ATP binding. Functional analyses of ABBC2 and ABBC3 support the role of both proteins in the mode of action of Bt toxins in S. exigua. Partial silencing of these genes with dsRNA decreased the susceptibility of wild type larvae to both Cry1Ac and Cry1Ca.

Compressive and tensile properties were also significantly increased, as compared to untreated and PTH groups. PTH treatment did not result in notable tissue changes. As T3 induces hypertrophy, in Phase 2, PTH (known to suppress hypertrophy) was applied sequentially after T3. Excitingly, sequential treatment with T3 and PTH reduced expression of hypertrophic marker collagen X, while yielding neocartilage with significantly enhanced functional properties. Specifically, in comparison to no hormone application, these hormones increased compressive and tensile moduli 4.0-fold and 3.1-fold, respectively."

Insulin sensitivity was measured using a hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic clamp in the final 2 hours of each infusion.

In turn, these LDLN eosinophils elicited the accumulation of dendritic cells and CD4(+) T cells to these same LDLNs without inducing pulmonary inflammation. However, exposure of eosinophils to GM-CSF, IL-4, and IL-33 prior to transfer induced not only immune events in the LDLN, but also allergen-mediated increases in airway Th2 cytokine/chemokine levels, the subsequent accumulation of CD4(+) T cells as well as alternatively activated (M2) macrophages, and the induction of pulmonary histopathologies.

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) affects genetic stability by regulating DNA methylation and interacting with environmental carcinogens. To establish a Gnmt knockout mouse model, 2 lambda phage clones containing a mouse Gnmt genome were isolated. At 11 weeks of age, the Gnmt-/- mice had hepatomegaly, hypermethioninemia, and significantly higher levels of both serum alanine aminotransferase and hepatic S-adenosylmethionine. Such phenotypes mimic patients with congenital GNMT deficiencies. A real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of 10 genes in the one-carbon metabolism pathway revealed that 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (Ahcy), and formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase (Ftcd) were significantly down-regulated in Gnmt-/- mice. This report demonstrates that GNMT regulates the expression of both Ftcd and Ahcy genes. Results from pathological examinations indicated that 57.1% (8 of 14) of the Gnmt-/- mice had glycogen storage disease (GSD) in their livers. Focal necrosis was observed in male Gnmt-/- livers, whereas degenerative changes were found in the intermediate zones of female Gnmt-/- livers. In addition, hypoglycemia, increased serum cholesterol, and significantly lower numbers of white blood cells, neutrophils, and monocytes were observed in the Gnmt-/- mice. A real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of genes involved in the gluconeogenesis pathways revealed that the following genes were significantly down-regulated in Gnmt-/- mice: fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and glucose-6-phosphate transporter."

We used a number of assays to understand whether 2F5 and 4E10 are autoreactive, polyreactive, or have a generalized affinity for lipids that may facilitate recognition of their membrane proximal epitopes.",

      "2F5 showed completely negative results in the APS and SPR studies, indicating that it is neither autoreactive nor absolutely requires phospholipid binding for epitope recognition. In contrast, 4E10 bound to more than one lipid and showed weak activity in the APS studies. The activity displayed by 4E10 more closely resembles that of antiphospholipid antibodies elicited during many infections than that of autoimmune APS antibodies, at variance with the notion that difficulites in eliciting 4E10-like antibodies can be attributed to tolerance mechanisms. The microarray studies further indicated that broadly neutralizing anti-HIV mAb are not exceptionally polyreactive."

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Cryptocaryon irritans is a parasitic ciliate that causes cryptocaryonosis (white spot disease) in marine fish. Diagnosis of cryptocaryonosis often depends on the appearance of white spots on the surface of the fish, which are usually visible only during later stages of the disease. Identifying suitable biomarkers of this parasite would aid the development of diagnostic tools and control strategies for C. irritans. The C. irritans genome is virtually unexplored; therefore, we generated and analyzed expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of the parasite to identify genes that encode for surface proteins, excretory/secretory proteins and repeat-containing proteins.",
      "ESTs were generated from a cDNA library of C. irritans tomonts isolated from infected Asian sea bass, Lates calcarifer. Clustering of the 5356 ESTs produced 2659 unique transcripts (UTs) containing 1989 singletons and 670 consensi. BLAST analysis showed that 74% of the UTs had significant similarity (E-value < 10-5) to sequences that are currently available in the GenBank database, with more than 15% of the significant hits showing unknown function. Forty percent of the UTs had significant similarity to ciliates from the genera Tetrahymena and Paramecium. Comparative gene family analysis with related taxa showed that many protein families are conserved among the protozoans. Based on gene ontology annotation, functional groups were successfully assigned to 790 UTs. Genes encoding excretory/secretory proteins and membrane and membrane-associated proteins were identified because these proteins often function as antigens and are good antibody targets. A total of 481 UTs were classified as encoding membrane proteins, 54 were classified as encoding for membrane-bound proteins, and 155 were found to contain excretory/secretory protein-coding sequences. Amino acid repeat-containing proteins and GPI-anchored proteins were also identified as potential candidates for the development of diagnostic and control strategies for C. irritans."

Compared with the treatment with cisplatin alone, treatment with TRAIL (100 µg/L) and cisplatin (8.49 mg/L, IC(50) dose of 24 h) led to a dramatic increase in both inhibition of cell proliferation [(52.58 ± 4.57)% vs. (76.43 ± 5.35)%, P < 0.05] and cell apoptosis [(23.10 ± 3.41)% vs. (42.56 ± 4.11)%, P < 0.05]. Moreover, cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-3 was detected. TRAIL (100 µg/L) did not induce obvious lipid rafts aggregation and death receptor 4 (DR4) clustering, while cisplatin (8.49 mg/L) significantly promoted the localization of DR4 in aggregated lipid rafts. Pretreatment with 50 mg/L nystatin, a cholesterol-sequestering agent, triggered (3.66 ± 0.52)% cell apoptosis after 24 h. Pretreatment with nystatin for 1 h before the addition of 8.49 mg/L cisplatin for 24 h caused a decreased tendency to cell apoptosis [(25.74 ± 3.28)% vs. (22.76 ± 2.97)%].

Isolated myocytes were used in proximity ligation assay studies to detect localization of signaling intermediaries with Kv7.4 before and after cell stimulation. Our studies showed that the EPAC activator (8-pCPT-2Me-cAMP-AM) produced relaxations and enhanced currents of MA and RA that were sensitive to linopirdine (Kv7 inhibitor). Linopirdine also inhibited isoproterenol-mediated relaxations in both RA and MA. In the MA, isoproterenol relaxations were sensitive to EPAC inhibition, but not protein kinase A inhibition. In contrast, isoproterenol relaxations in RA were attenuated by protein kinase A but not by EPAC inhibition. Proximity ligation assay showed a localization of Kv7.4 with A-kinase anchoring protein in both vessels in the basal state, which increased only in the RA with isoproterenol stimulation.

Measurements from these non-specific probes likely represent a combination of DNAm from multiple genomic sites. The expanded biological annotation demonstrated that based on DNAm, grouping probes by an alternative high-density and intermediate-density CpG island classification provided a distinctive pattern of DNAm. Finally, variable enrichment for differentially methylated probes was noted across CpG classes and gene feature groups, dependant on the tissues that were compared."

Plasminogen deficient mice have severely delayed wound closure as have mice simultaneously lacking the two plasminogen activators, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). In contrast, individual genetic deficiencies in either uPA or tPA lead to wound healing kinetics with no or only slightly delayed closure of skin wounds.",

Systemic administration of the anti-mouse uPA monoclonal antibody, mU1, to tPA-deficient mice caused a dose-dependent delay of skin wound closure almost similar to the delayed kinetics observed in uPA;tPA double-deficient mice. Analysis of wound extracts showed diminished levels of plasmin in the mU1-treated tPA-deficient mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed that fibrin accumulated in the wounds of such mU1-treated tPA-deficient mice and that keratinocyte tongues were aberrant.

Abnormalities of the autophagic activity may result in the accumulation of protein aggregates, organelle dysfunction, and autophagy disorders were associated with various diseases. Hence, mechanisms of autophagy regulation are under exploration.",
      "Over-expression of hsa-miR-376a1 (shortly MIR376A) was performed to evaluate its effects on autophagy. Autophagy-related targets of the miRNA were predicted using Microcosm Targets and MIRanda bioinformatics tools and experimentally validated. Endogenous miRNA was blocked using antagomirs and the effects on target expression and autophagy were analyzed. Luciferase tests were performed to confirm that 3' UTR sequences in target genes were functional. Differential expression of MIR376A and the related MIR376B was compared using TaqMan quantitative PCR.",
      "Here, we demonstrated that, a microRNA (miRNA) from the DLK1/GTL2 gene cluster, MIR376A, played an important role in autophagy regulation. We showed that, amino acid and serum starvation-induced autophagy was blocked by MIR376A overexpression in MCF-7 and Huh7 cells. MIR376A shared the same seed sequence and had overlapping targets with MIR376B, and similarly blocked the expression of key autophagy proteins ATG4C and BECN1 (Beclin 1). Indeed, 3' UTR sequences in the mRNA of these autophagy proteins were responsive to MIR376A in luciferase assays. Antagomir tests showed that, endogenous MIR376A was participating to the control of ATG4C and BECN1 transcript and protein levels. Moreover, blockage of endogenous MIR376A accelerated starvation-induced autophagic activity. Interestingly, MIR376A and MIR376B levels were increased with different kinetics in response to starvation stress and tissue-specific level differences were also observed, pointing out to an overlapping but miRNA-specific biological role."

    "QUESTION": "Are mammalian target of Rapamycin inhibition and mycobacterial survival uncoupled in murine macrophages?",
    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Autophagy is a cellular response to intracellular pathogens including mycobacteria and is induced by the direct inhibitors of mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a major negative regulator of autophagy. Autophagy induction by mTOR inhibition (mTOR dependent autophagy), through chemical means or starvation, leads to mycobacterial killing in infected cells. However, previous work by our group has shown that mycobacterial infection of macrophages naturally induces both autophagy and mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) activity (mTOR independent autophagy). In the current work, we further explore the relationship between mTOR activity and mycobacterial killing in macrophages.",
      "While low concentrations of the mTOR inhibitors, Rapamycin, Torin 1, and Torin 2, can effectively reduce or block mTOR activity in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or mycobacteria, higher concentrations (10 uM) are required to observe Mycobacterium smegmatis killing. The growth of M. smegmatis was also inhibited by high concentrations of Rapamycin in LC3B and ATG5 deficient bone marrow derived macrophages, suggesting that non-autophagic mechanisms might contribute to killing at high doses. Since mycobacterial killing could be observed only at fairly high concentrations of the mTOR inhibitors, exceeding doses necessary to inhibit mTOR, we hypothesized that high doses of Rapamycin, the most commonly utilized mTOR inhibitor for inducing autophagic killing, may exert a direct bactericidal effect on the mycobacteria. Although a short-term treatment of mycobacteria with Rapamycin did not substantially affect mycobacterial growth, a long-term exposure to Rapamycin could impact mycobacterial growth in vitro in select species."

After oral administration of 2.5 mg/g body weight of the broccoli sprout preparations, SF was quickly absorbed and distributed throughout the tissues. The SF-rich preparation resulted in the highest exposure, with peak plasma SF concentration of 337 ng/mL, which is 6.0 times and 2.6 times higher compared to the other two preparations.

However, the biological effects of such treatments are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to identify the main effects of an androgen masculinizing treatment (11beta-hydroxyandrostenedione, 11betaOHDelta4, 10 mg/kg of food for 3 months) on gonadal gene expression profiles of an all-female genetic population of trout. To characterize the most important molecular features of this process, we used a large scale gene expression profiling approach using rainbow trout DNA microarrays combined with a detailed gene ontology (GO) analysis.",
      "2,474 genes were characterized as up-regulated or down-regulated in trout female gonads masculinized by androgen in comparison with control male or female gonads from untreated all-male and all-female genetic populations. These genes were classified in 13 k-means clusters of temporally correlated expression profiles. Gene ontology (GO) data mining revealed that androgen treatment triggers a marked down-regulation of genes potentially involved in early oogenesis processes (GO 'mitotic cell cycle', 'nucleolus'), an up-regulation of the translation machinery (GO 'ribosome') along with a down-regulation of proteolysis (GO 'proteolysis', 'peptidase' and 'metallopeptidase activity'). Genes considered as muscle fibres markers (GO 'muscle contraction') and genes annotated as structural constituents of the extracellular matrix (GO 'extracellular matrix') or related to meiosis (GO 'chromosome' and 'meiosis') were found significantly enriched in the two clusters of genes specifically up-regulated in androgen-treated female gonads. GO annotations 'Sex differentiation' and 'steroid biosynthesis' were enriched in a cluster of genes with high expression levels only in control males. Interestingly none of these genes were stimulated by the masculinizing androgen treatment."

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "The existence of \"ancient asexuals\", taxa that have persisted for long periods of evolutionary history without sexual recombination, is both controversial and important for our understanding of the evolution and maintenance of sexual reproduction. A lack of sex has consequences not only for the ecology of the asexual organism but also for its genome. Several genetic signatures are predicted from long-term asexual (apomictic) reproduction including (i) large \"allelic\" sequence divergence (ii) lack of phylogenetic clustering of \"alleles\" within morphological species and (iii) decay and loss of genes specific to meiosis and sexual reproduction. These genetic signatures can be hard to assess since it is difficult to demonstrate the allelic nature of very divergent sequences, divergence levels may be complicated by processes such as inter-specific hybridization, and genes may have secondary roles unrelated to sexual reproduction. Apomictic species of Meloidogyne root knot nematodes have been suggested previously to be ancient asexuals. Their relatives reproduce by meiotic parthenogenesis or facultative sexuality, which in combination with the abundance of nematode genomic sequence data, makes them a powerful system in which to study the consequences of reproductive mode on genomic divergence.",
      "Here, sequences from nuclear protein-coding genes are used to demonstrate that the first two predictions of ancient asexuality are found within the apomictic root knot nematodes. Alleles are more divergent in the apomictic taxa than in those species exhibiting recombination and do not group phylogenetically according to recognized species. In contrast some nuclear alleles, and mtDNA, are almost identical across species. Sequencing of Major Sperm Protein, a gamete-specific gene, from both meiotic and ameiotic species reveals no increase in evolutionary rate nor change in substitution pattern in the apomictic taxa, indicating that the locus has been maintained by selection."

We hypothesized that if neuronal activity were primarily responsible for reperfusion hyperemia, then electrocerebral silence induced by intracarotid anesthetics (propofol and pentothal) would attenuate the hyperemic response. New Zealand white rabbits were subjected to 10 min of cerebral ischemia using bilateral carotid occlusion and systemic hypotension. Subsequently, carotid occlusion was released, and the mean arterial blood pressure was increased to baseline values. In the control group, intracarotid saline was periodically injected during reperfusion. In the treatment groups, intracarotid propofol or thiopental was administered to maintain electrocerebral silence for 10 min. Physiological data were measured at baseline, during ischemia, and at reperfusion. Satisfactory data were available for 16 of 19 rabbits. Mean arterial blood pressure, end-tidal CO(2), and cerebral blood flows decreased significantly in both groups during carotid occlusion. During early reperfusion, a similar percent increase in cerebral blood flow from baseline values was observed in all 3 groups (192% +/- 76%, 218% +/- 84%, and 185% +/- 101% for saline, propofol, and pentothal, respectively).

Tissue microarray analysis revealed that FHL2 protein expression is high in human osteosarcoma and correlates with osteosarcoma aggressiveness. In murine osteosarcoma cells, FHL2 silencing using shRNA decreased canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling and reduced the expression of Wnt responsive genes as well as of the key Wnt molecules Wnt5a and Wnt10b. This effect resulted in inhibition of osteosarcoma cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro. Using xenograft experiments, we showed that FHL2 silencing markedly reduced tumor growth and lung metastasis occurence in mice. The anti-oncogenic effect of FHL2 silencing in vivo was associated with reduced cell proliferation and decreased Wnt signaling in the tumors."

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Neutrophils are key-players in the innate host defense and their programmed cell death and removal are essential for efficient resolution of inflammation. These cells recognize a variety of pathogens, and the NOD-like receptors (NLRs) have been suggested as intracellular sensors of microbial components and cell injury/stress. Some NLR will upon activation form multi-protein complexes termed inflammasomes that result in IL-1β production. NLR mutations are associated with auto-inflammatory syndromes, and our previous data propose NLRP3 (Q705K)/CARD-8 (C10X) polymorphisms to contribute to increased risk and severity of inflammatory disease by acting as genetic susceptibility factors. These gene products are components of the NALP3 inflammasome, and approximately 6.5% of the Swedish population are heterozygote carriers of these combined gene variants. Since patients carrying the Q705K/C10X polymorphisms display leukocytosis, the aim of the present study was to find out whether the inflammatory phenotype was related to dysfunctional apoptosis and impaired clearance of neutrophils by macrophages.",

These findings are explained by altered involvement of different regulators of apoptosis, resulting in an anti-apoptotic profile. Moreover, the macrophage response to ingestion of microbe-induced apoptotic neutrophils is altered in the patients. Taken together, the patients display impaired turnover and clearance of apoptotic neutrophils, pointing towards a dysregulated innate immune response that influences the resolution of inflammation. The future challenge is to understand how microbes affect the activation of inflammasomes, and why this interaction will develop into severe inflammatory disease in certain individuals.",

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Chronic liver disease is associated with hepatocyte injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Chemokines and chemokine receptors are key factors for the migration of inflammatory cells such as macrophages and noninflammatory cells such as hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). The expression of CX3CR1 and its ligand, CX3CL1, is up-regulated in chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C. However, the precise role of CX3CR1 in the liver is still unclear. Here we investigated the role of the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 interaction in a carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced liver inflammation and fibrosis model. CX3CR1 was dominantly expressed in Kupffer cells in the liver. In contrast, the main source of CX3CL1 was HSCs. Mice deficient in CX3CR1 showed significant increases in inflammatory cell recruitment and cytokine production [including tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α); monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; macrophage inflammatory protein 1β; and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted (RANTES)] after CCl(4) treatment versus wild-type (WT) mice. This suggested that CX3CR1 signaling prevented liver inflammation. Kupffer cells in CX3CR1-deficient mice after CCl(4) treatment showed increased expression of TNF-α and transforming growth factor β and reduced expression of the anti-inflammatory markers interleukin-10 (IL-10) and arginase-1. Coculture experiments showed that HSCs experienced significantly greater activation by Kupffer cells from CCl(4)-treated CX3CR1-deficient mice versus WT mice. Indeed, augmented fibrosis was observed in CX3CR1-deficient mice versus WT mice after CCl(4) treatment. Finally, CX3CL1 treatment induced the expression of IL-10 and arginase-1 in WT cultured Kupffer cells through CX3CR1, which in turn suppressed HSC activation."

We now report confirmation of this locus in congenic strains carrying the MOLF-derived susceptibility allele in the C57BL/6J-Ldlr(-/-) genetic background. Homozygous congenic mice exhibited up to 4.5-fold greater lesion area compared to noncongenic littermates (P<0.0001). Analysis of extracellular matrix composition revealed prominent accumulation of versican, a presumed proatherogenic matrix component abundant in human lesions but almost absent in the widely-used C57BL/6 murine atherosclerosis model. The results of a bone marrow transplantation experiment suggested that both accelerated lesion development and versican accumulation are mediated, at least in part, by macrophages.

In this context, it is important to analyze the innate immune host responses triggered against ChikV. Autophagy has been shown to be an important component of the innate immune response and is involved in host defense elimination of different pathogens. However, the autophagic process was recently observed to be hijacked by virus for their own replication. Here we provide the first evidence that hallmarks of autophagy are specifically found in HEK.293 infected cells and are involved in ChikV replication.",

To confirm this, we performed electron microscopy on HEK.293 infected cells. To test the effect of ChikV-induced-autophagy on viral replication, we blocked the autophagic process, either by pharmacological (3-MA) or genetic inhibition (siRNA against the transcript of Beclin 1, an autophagic protein), and analyzed the percentage of infected cells and the viral RNA load released in the supernatant. Moreover, the effect of induction of autophagy by Rapamycin on viral replication was tested.",

Co-infusing the EGFR inhibitor AG1478, the broad-spectrum MMP-inhibitor GM6001, or a highly selective MMP-8 inhibitor abolished BK's protection, thus suggesting an MMP-8-dependent EGFR transactivation in the signalling. Eighty minutes of exposure to calcimycin reduced the mean cell fluorescence to 37.4 +/- 1.8% of untreated cells while BK could partly preserve the fluorescence and, hence, protect the cells (50.5 +/- 2.3%, P < 0.001). The BK-induced mitochondrial protection could again be blocked by AG1478, GM6001 and MMP-8 inhibitor.

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Regenerating damaged tissue is a complex process, requiring progenitor cells that must be stimulated to undergo proliferation, differentiation and, often, migratory behaviors and morphological changes. Multiple cell types, both resident within the damaged tissue and recruited to the lesion site, have been shown to participate. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation after injury, and their regulation by different cells types, are not fully understood. The zebrafish lateral line is a suitable system to study regeneration because most of its components are fully restored after damage. The posterior lateral line (PLL) is a mechanosensory system that develops embryonically and is initially composed of seven to eight neuromasts distributed along the trunk and tail, connected by a continuous stripe of interneuromastic cells (INCs). The INCs remain in a quiescent state owing to the presence of underlying Schwann cells. They become activated during development to form intercalary neuromasts. However, no studies have described if INCs can participate in a regenerative event, for example, after the total loss of a neuromast.",
      "We used electroablation in transgenic larvae expressing fluorescent proteins in PLL components to completely ablate single neuromasts in larvae and adult fish. This injury results in discontinuity of the INCs, Schwann cells, and the PLL nerve. In vivo imaging showed that the INCs fill the gap left after the injury and can regenerate a new neuromast in the injury zone. Further, a single INC is able to divide and form all cell types in a regenerated neuromast and, during this process, it transiently expresses the sox2 gene, a neural progenitor cell marker. We demonstrate a critical role for Schwann cells as negative regulators of INC proliferation and neuromast regeneration, and that this inhibitory property is completely dependent on active ErbB signaling."

The piRNA system is thought to provide primarily a germline defense against TE activity.",

In contrast to piRNAs, we find that the TE-siRNA system is active in somatic tissues, and particularly so in various immortalized cell lines. Analysis of the patterns and properties of TE-derived small RNAs reveals further distinctions between TE regions and genomic loci that are converted into piRNAs and siRNAs, respectively. Finally, functional tests show that many transposon transcripts accumulate to higher levels in cells and animal tissues that are deficient for Dicer-2 or Argonaute-2."

The gene is highly expressed in the hypothalamus and is thought to mediate this effect through its influence on energy homeostasis. The hypothalamus, however, also regulates blood pressure (BP). Therefore, we investigated whether the FTO-risk variant is associated not only with increased adiposity but also with elevated BP and whether the latter may be mediated, in part, by increased sympathetic modulation of vasomotor tone.",
      "The primary study was carried out in 485 adolescents recruited from a French Canadian founder population who underwent detailed body-composition and cardiovascular phenotyping. Body fat was examined with MRI, bioimpedance, and anthropometry. BP was recorded beat to beat at rest and during physical and mental challenges. Sympathetic modulation of vasomotor tone was assessed with power spectral analysis of BP. We found that individuals with the FTO-risk genotype compared with those without it demonstrate greater adiposity, including the amount of intra-abdominal fat (by 38%). They also showed higher systolic BP throughout the entire protocol, with a maximum difference during a mental stress (6.4 [1.5 to 11.3] mm Hg). The difference in BP was accompanied by elevated index of sympathetic modulation of vasomotor tone. A replication in an independent sample of adults from the same founder population confirmed the association between FTO and BP."

A colorectal clinic was established within this environment in 1991 and has served as the exclusive provider for the care of anorectal pathology in these patients. A prospective database of patients treated at this clinic was reviewed for two 18-month periods. The first group (early period) was composed of patients treated between January 1994 through June 1995, before the institution of more effective antiretroviral therapy. The second group (later period) consisted of patients treated between January 2001 through June 2002, after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Data were tabulated for HIV-related anorectal pathologies, such as anal ulcer and anogenital condyloma, and non-HIV-related pathologies, including fissure, fistula in ano, hemorrhoids, perianal abscess, and other pathologies, for each of the two time periods.",
      "A total of 117 individual patients with anorectal pathology were treated in the early period and 109 received care in the later period, of which 107 were able to be evaluated. The pathology was distributed as follows for the early vs. late periods: 33 vs. 33 percent for ulcer, 30 vs. 34 percent for condyloma, 9 vs. 4 percent for fissure, 6 vs. 6 percent for fistula, 4 vs. 5 percent for hemorrhoids, 3 vs. 3 percent for abscess, and 15 vs. 16 percent for all other anorectal pathology.

      "Coronary microvascular diameters were measured using stroboscopic epi-illumination and intravital microscopy during fluorescein microangiography in open-chested dogs (n = 20). Both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors were selectively activated by intracoronary infusions of norepinephrine (0.05 and 0.2 microgram.kg-1 x min-1) in the presence of the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist rauwolscine (0.2 mg/kg) or the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin (0.75 mg/kg) during beta-adrenergic blockade (1 mg/kg propranolol). Microvascular diameters during selective alpha-adrenergic receptor activation were measured under baseline conditions and after inhibition of endogenous nitric oxide synthesis by an analogue of L-arginine, either NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, 30 mg/kg) or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 30 mg/kg). Under baseline conditions, alpha 1-adrenergic activation constricted small arteries (vessels with diameters between 100 and 300 microns) (4 +/- 1% and 5 +/- 1% decrease in diameter for the low and high doses of norepinephrine, respectively, both p < 0.05) but did not change the diameter of arterioles (vessels with diameters < 100 microns). In contrast, alpha 2-adrenergic activation by the lower but not the higher dose of norepinephrine induced constriction of arterioles (6 +/- 2% and 3 +/- 4% decrease in diameter, p < 0.05 and NS, respectively) but not small arteries. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase activity by either L-NA or L-NAME produced constriction of small coronary arteries (9 +/- 2% decrease in diameter, p < 0.01) and arterioles (6 +/- 1% decrease in diameter, p < 0.05). The dilatation of small arteries and arterioles by acetylcholine (0.05 microgram-1 x kg-1 x min-1 intracoronary infusion; 10 +/- 1% increase in diameter under baseline conditions, p < 0.05) was abolished by either analogue. Both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic coronary microvascular constriction were markedly potentiated after L-NA or L-NAME. alpha 1-Adrenergic constriction was unmasked in arterioles (7 +/- 3% and 10 +/- 4% decrease in diameter, p < 0.05), although it was not significantly increased in small arteries. Conversely, alpha 2-adrenergic constriction was unmasked in small arteries (8 +/- 1% and 6 +/- 2% decrease in diameter, both p < 0.05) and potentiated in arterioles (12 +/- 1% and 8 +/- 4% decrease in diameter, both p < 0.05). After L-NA or L-NAME, microvessels retained the ability to dilate to sodium nitroprusside (0.1 microgram.kg-1 x min-1 intracoronary infusion; 10 +/- 2% increase in diameter, p < 0.05). alpha-Adrenergic constriction was not accentuated by increased tone alone, since it was either attenuated or converted to dilatation during a similar degree of preconstriction by the endothelium-independent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II (p < 0.05 for both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic activation)."

We demonstrated that the repression of ERBB3 by miR-143/145 suppressed the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells, and that miR-143/145 showed an anti-tumor effect by negatively regulating ERBB3 in the xenograft mouse model. Interestingly, miR-143 and miR-145 showed a cooperative repression of ERBB3 expression and cell proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells, such that the effects of the two miRNAs were greater than with either miR-143 or miR-145 alone."

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "A population of stromal cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), is present in tumors. Though studies have gradually revealed the protumorigenic functions of MDSCs, the molecular mechanisms guiding MDSC recruitment remain largely elusive. Hypoxia, O2 deprivation, is an important factor in the tumor microenvironment of solid cancers, whose growth often exceeds the growth of functional blood vessels. Here, using hepatocellular carcinoma as the cancer model, we show that hypoxia is an important driver of MDSC recruitment. We observed that MDSCs preferentially infiltrate into hypoxic regions in human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and that hypoxia-induced MDSC infiltration is dependent on hypoxia-inducible factors. We further found that hypoxia-inducible factors activate the transcription of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 26 in cancer cells to recruit chemokine (C-X3-C motif) receptor 1-expressing MDSCs to the primary tumor. Knockdown of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 26 in cancer cells profoundly reduces MDSC recruitment, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. Therapeutically, blockade of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 26 production in cancer cells by the hypoxia-inducible factor inhibitor digoxin or blockade of chemokine (C-X3-C motif) receptor 1 in MDSCs by chemokine (C-X3-C motif) receptor 1 neutralizing antibody could substantially suppress MDSC recruitment and tumor growth."

    "QUESTION": "Does patient-reported physical functioning predict the success of hematopoietic cell transplantation ( BMT CTN 0902 )?",
    "CONTEXTS": [
      "In hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), current risk adjustment strategies are based on clinical and disease-related variables. Although patient-reported outcomes (PROs) predict mortality in multiple cancers, they have been less well studied within HCT. Improvements in risk adjustment strategies in HCT would inform patient selection, patient counseling, and quality reporting. The objective of the current study was to determine whether pre-HCT PROs, in particular physical health, predict survival among patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic transplantation.",
      "In this secondary analysis, the authors studied pre-HCT PROs that were reported by 336 allogeneic and 310 autologous HCT recipients enrolled in the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) 0902 protocol, a study with broad representation of patients who underwent transplantation in the United States.",
      "Among allogeneic HCT recipients, the pre-HCT Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS) scale independently predicted overall mortality (hazards ratio, 1.40 per 10-point decrease; P<.001) and performed at least as well as currently used, non-PRO risk indices. Survival probability estimates at 1 year for the first, second, third, and fourth quartiles of the baseline PCS were 50%, 65%, 75%, and 83%, respectively. Early post-HCT decreases in PCS were associated with higher overall and treatment-related mortality. When adjusted for patient variables included in the US Stem Cell Therapeutic Outcomes Database model for transplant center-specific reporting, the SF-36 PCS retained independent prognostic value."

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether (1) ET(B) receptor antagonists prevent and reverse SAH-induced spasm and (2) attenuation of the spasm results from blockade of smooth muscle ET(B) (ET(B2)) receptor-mediated constriction and/or endothelial ET(B) (ET(B1)) receptor-mediated ET-1-induced ET-1 release.",
      "SAH-induced spasm of the rabbit basilar artery was induced with the use of a double hemorrhage model. In vivo effects of agents on the spasm were determined by angiography after their intracisternal infusion (10 microL/h) by mini osmotic pump. In situ effects of agents on the spasm were determined by direct measurement of vessel diameter after their suffusion in a cranial window.",
      "SAH constricted the basilar artery by 30%. Intracisternal infusion with 10 micromol/L BQ788, an ET(B1/B2) receptor antagonist, reduced the spasm to 10%. To investigate whether BQ788 prevented the spasm by blockade of ET(B1) receptor-mediated ET-1-induced ET-1 release, as opposed to ET(B2) receptor-mediated constriction, we tested whether ET(B1) receptor blockade also prevented the spasm. Indeed, intracisternal infusion with 10 micromol/L RES-701-1, a selective ET(B1) receptor antagonist, reduced the spasm to 10%. Similarly, in situ superfusion with 1 micromol/L BQ788 reversed the spasm by 40%, and 1 micromol/L RES-701-1 reversed the spasm by 50%. However, both BQ788 and RES-701-1 enhanced by 40% to 50% the 3 nmol/L ET-1-induced constriction elicited in spastic vessels previously relaxed with 0.1 mmol/L phosphoramidon, an ET-converting enzyme inhibitor."

      "Atorvastatin, a lipid-lowering medication, exerted a broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory functions by reducing T-cell immune activation markers (e.g. CD38, HLA-DR and Ki67), lowering HIV-1 co-receptor CCR-5, and decreasing proliferative capabilities of CD4 T cells in vitro. In contrast, atorvastatin expanded regulatory T cells (Tregs) and upregulated the expression of T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), which enhanced the suppressive activity of Tregs. Furthermore, atorvastatin upregulated the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, which is also known as cip-1 and waf-1, in the CD4 T cells. Upregulation of p21 in CD4 T cells rendered them less susceptible to HIV-1 infection and replication whereas siRNA-mediated p21 depletion and/or p21 selective inhibitor rescued viral replication. Interestingly, atorvastatin reduced HIV infection in both rested and phytohemagglutinin-activated CD4 T cells in vitro. Finally, atorvastatin mediated p21 upregulation occurred via mevalonate pathway, but independent of p53."

    "QUESTION": "Does β-blockade restore muscle sympathetic rhythmicity in human heart failure?",
    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Muscle sympathetic nerve firing rate increases as chronic heart failure (CHF) progresses, yet its oscillation, particularly within the frequency range encompassing 0.13 Hz, diminishes. The current study tested the hypothesis that chronic therapy with lipophilic β-adrenoceptor antagonists augments the modulation of muscle sympathetic nerve activity variability (MSNAV) at this frequency range.",
      "In 21 CHF angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-treated patients (age: 53 ± 2, ejection fraction: 20 ± 2%), MSNA was recorded before and after 4 months of β-blockade with either metoprolol (up to 50mg b.i.d.) or carvedilol (up to 25mg b.i.d.). Harmonic MSNAV was assessed by coarse graining spectral analysis. Both drugs lowered heart rate similarly (-13 ± 2 beats/min; P < 0.001) but neither affected MSNA burst frequency (-7 ± 4 bursts/min, not significant). Before β-blockade, harmonic MSNA power in the region encompassing 0.13 Hz was essentially absent. Beta-blockade increased the mean values for total power (from 0.00 to 0.50 Hz; 5.2 ± 0.8 to 6.8 ± 1.2U(2); P < 0.001) and for harmonic MSNA spectral power across the 0.1-0.22 Hz frequency range (from 0.48 ± 0.10 to 1.50 ± 0.32 U(2), F = 12.2; P < 0.001). Both carvedilol and metoprolol had a similar effect."

However, a lack of genome information of sugarcane has hindered the development of genome-assisted resistance breeding programs. Furthermore, the molecular basis of sugarcane response to S. scitamineum infection at the proteome level was incomplete and combining proteomic and transcriptional analysis has not yet been conducted.",

The proteome quantitative data were then validated by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The integrative analysis showed that the correlations between the quantitative proteins and the corresponding genes that was obtained in our previous transcriptome study were poor, which were 0.1502 and 0.2466 in Yacheng05-179 and ROC22, respectively, thereby revealing a post-transcriptional event during Yacheng05-179-S. scitamineum incompatible interaction and ROC22-S. scitamineum compatible interaction. Most differentially expressed proteins were closely related to sugarcane smut resistance such as beta-1,3-glucanase, peroxidase, pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR1), endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, heat shock protein, and lectin. Ethylene and gibberellic acid pathways, phenylpropanoid metabolism and PRs, such as PR1, PR2, PR5 and PR14, were more active in Yacheng05-179, which suggested of their possible roles in sugarcane smut resistance. However, calcium signaling, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and abscisic acid pathways in Yacheng05-179 were repressed by S. scitamineum and might not be crucial for defense against this particular pathogen."

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "The C-terminus of the serotonin transporter (SERT) contains binding domains for different proteins and is critical for its functional expression. In endogenous and heterologous expression systems, our proteomic and biochemical analysis demonstrated that an intermediate filament, vimentin, binds to the C-terminus of SERT. It has been reported that 5HT-stimulation of cells leads to disassembly and spatial reorientation of vimentin filaments.",
      "We tested the impact of 5HT-stimulation on vimentin-SERT association and found that 5HT-stimulation accelerates the translocation of SERT from the plasma membrane via enhancing the level of association between phosphovimentin and SERT. Furthermore a progressive truncation of the C-terminus of SERT was performed to map the vimentin-SERT association domain. Deletion of up to 20, but not 14 amino acids arrested the transporters at intracellular locations. Although, truncation of the last 14 amino acids, did not alter 5HT uptake rates of transporter but abolished its association with vimentin. To understand the involvement of 5HT in phosphovimentin-SERT association from the plasma membrane, we further investigated the six amino acids between Delta14 and Delta20, i.e., the SITPET sequence of SERT. While the triple mutation on the possible kinase action sites, S(611), T(613), and T(616) arrested the transporter at intracellular locations, replacing the residues with aspartic acid one at a time altered neither the 5HT uptake rates nor the vimentin association of these mutants. However, replacing the three target sites with alanine, either simultaneously or one at a time, had no significant effect on 5HT uptake rates or the vimentin association with transporter."

    "QUESTION": "Is a functional polymorphism of the microRNA-146a gene associated with susceptibility to drug-resistant epilepsy and seizures frequency?",
    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Epilepsy is the third most common chronic brain disorder and is characterized by an enduring predisposition for seizures. Recently, a growing body of evidence has suggested that microRNA-146a (miR-146a) is upregulated in the brains of epilepsy patients and of mouse models; furthermore, miR-146a may be involved in the development and progression of seizures through the regulation of inflammation and immune responses. In this report, we performed a case-control study to analyze the relationship between the two potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the miR-146a gene (rs2910464 and rs57095329) and the risk of epilepsy in a Chinese population comprising 249 cases and 249 healthy controls.",
      "Our study comprised 249 epilepsy patients and 249 healthy controls in two regions of China. The DNA was genotyped using the ABI PRISM SNapShot method. The statistical analysis was estimated using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test.",
      "Our results indicated a significant association between the rs57095329 SNP of the miR-146a gene and the risk of drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) (genotypes, p = 0.0258 and alleles, p = 0.0108). Moreover, the rs57095329 A allele was found to be associated with a reduced risk of seizures frequency in DRE patients (all p < 0.001). However, the rs2910164 variant was not associated with epilepsy."

IR moderately stimulated mTOR activity, and this was substantially exacerbated in the absence of AMPK. AMPK was required for IR induced expression of the mTOR inhibitor REDD1, indicating that AMPK restrains mTOR activity through multiple mechanisms. Likewise, cellular metabolism was deregulated following irradiation in the absence of AMPK, as evidenced by a substantial increase in oxygen consumption rates and lactate production. AMPK deficient cells showed impairment of the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint, and were unable to support long-term proliferation during starvation following radiation.

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Plants constantly monitor changes in photoperiod or day length to trigger the flowering cycle at the most appropriate time of the year. It is well established that photoperiodic flowering is intimately associated with the circadian clock in Arabidopsis. In support of this notion, many clock-defective mutants exhibit altered photoperiodic sensitivity in inducing flowering. LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and its functional paralogue CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) constitute the core of the circadian clock together with TIMING OF CAB EXPRSSION 1 (TOC1). While it is known that TOC1 contributes to the timing of flowering entirely by modulating the clock function, molecular mechanisms by which LHY and CCA1 regulate flowering time have not been explored.",
      "We investigated how LHY and CCA1 regulate photoperiodic flowering through molecular genetic and biochemical studies. It was found that LHY-defective mutants (lhy-7 and lhy-20) exhibit accelerated flowering under both long days (LDs) and short days (SDs). Consistent with the accelerated flowering phenotypes, gene expression analysis revealed that expression of the floral integrator FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is up-regulated in the lhy mutants. In addition, the expression peaks of GIGANTEA (GI) and FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX PROTEIN 1 (FKF1) genes, which constitute the clock output pathway that is linked with photoperiodic flowering, were advanced by approximately 4 h in the mutants. Furthermore, the up-regulation of FT disappeared when the endogenous circadian period is matched to the external light/dark cycles in the lhy-7 mutant. Notably, whereas CCA1 binds strongly to FT gene promoter, LHY does not show such DNA-binding activity."

    "QUESTION": "Is tMEFF2 a PDGF-AA binding protein with methylation-associated gene silencing in multiple cancer types including glioma?",
    "CONTEXTS": [
      "TMEFF2 is a protein containing a single EGF-like domain and two follistatin-like modules. The biological function of TMEFF2 remains unclear with conflicting reports suggesting both a positive and a negative association between TMEFF2 expression and human cancers.",
      "Here we report that the extracellular domain of TMEFF2 interacts with PDGF-AA. This interaction requires the amino terminal region of the extracellular domain containing the follistatin modules and cannot be mediated by the EGF-like domain alone. Furthermore, the extracellular domain of TMEFF2 interferes with PDGF-AA-stimulated fibroblast proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. TMEFF2 expression is downregulated in human brain cancers and is negatively correlated with PDGF-AA expression. Suppressed expression of TMEFF2 is associated with its hypermethylation in several human tumor types, including glioblastoma and cancers of ovarian, rectal, colon and lung origins. Analysis of glioma subtypes indicates that TMEFF2 hypermethylation and decreased expression are associated with a subset of non-Proneural gliomas that do not display CpG island methylator phentoype."

    "QUESTION": "Does etanercept induce low QRS voltage and autonomic dysfunction in mice with experimental Chagas disease?",
    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Chagas disease is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Chagasic cardiomyopathy is characterized by disorders of autonomic regulation and action potential conduction in the acute and chronic phases of infection. Although tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) has been linked to cardiomyopathy in experimental models and in patients with Chagas disease, other reports suggest that TNF-α may exert anti-parasitic actions during the acute phase of infection.",

    "CONTEXTS": [
      "Activation of the A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR) decreases production of inflammatory cytokines, prevents C. difficile toxin A-induced enteritis and, in combination with antibiotics, increases survival from sepsis in mice. We investigated whether A2AAR activation improves and A2AAR deletion worsens outcomes in a murine model of C. difficile (strain VPI10463) infection (CDI).",
      "C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with an antibiotic cocktail prior to infection and then treated with vancomycin with or without an A2AAR agonist. A2AAR-/- and littermate wild-type (WT) mice were similarly infected, and IFNγ and TNFα were measured at peak of and recovery from infection.",

Infected mice treated with vancomycin had less weight loss and diarrhea during antibiotic treatment but mortality increased to near 100% after discontinuation of antibiotics. Infected mice treated with both vancomycin and an A2AAR agonist, either ATL370 or ATL1222, had minimal weight loss and better long-term survival than mice treated with vancomycin alone. A2AAR KO mice were more susceptible than WT mice to death from CDI. Increases in cecal IFNγ and blood TNFα were pronounced in the absence of A2AARs."
